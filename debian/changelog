singularity-container (2.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Building an image is now more intuitive with the introduction of our build
    command. You don't need to worry about sizes or using create, or bootstrap
  * By default the build command now creates compressed read only containers
    using squashfs
  * Singularity now supports building additional base targets: local images,
    Singularity Hub, or the host operating system itself
  * A well documented solution for internal container modularity
    (http://containers-ftw.org/SCI-F/)
  * By popular demand and bribery, we are bringing back persistent instance
    support. You can now start up a container instance and using a given name,
    you can connect to that instance, and it keeps running even when you exit!
  * We are now using the network namespace to provide network isolation
  * Using a persistent overlay, you can modify a container image and all
    changes are written to the overlay layer
  * Cleanup and optimization of the Singularity image library
