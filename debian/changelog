singularity-container (2.5.0) unstable; urgency=high

  * Prevent a user from creating world writable files in root-owned directories 
    on the host system by manipulating symbolic links and bind mounts 
  * Prevent a user from creating folders outside of the container by 
    manipulating symbolic links in conjunction with the `--nv` option or by 
    bypassing check_mounted function with relative symlinks
  * Prevent a user from bypassing the `enable overlay = no` option in the 
    `singularity.conf` configuration file by setting an environment variable
  * Prevent a user from exploiting buffer overflows in `src/util/daemon.c` 
    and/or `src/lib/image/ext3/init.c` (reported by Erik Sjölund (DBB, 
    Stockholm University, Sweden))
  * Prevent a user from forging  of the pid_path to join any Singularity 
    namespace (reported by Erik Sjölund (DBB, Stockholm University, Sweden))
  * Restore docker-extract aufs whiteout handling that implements correct
    extraction of docker container layers. This adds libarchive-devel as a
    build time dep. At runtime libarchive is needed for whiteout handling. If
    libarchive is not available at runtime will fall back to previous
    extraction method.
  * Changed behavior of SINGULARITYENV_PATH to overwrite container PATH and
    added SINGULARITYENV_PREPEND_PATH and SINGULARITYENV_APPEND_PATH for users
    wanting to prepend or append to the container PATH at runtime
  * Support pulls from the NVIDIA cloud docker registry (fix by Justin Riley, 
    Harvard)
  * Close socket file descriptors in fd_cleanup
  * Fix conflict between `--nv` and `--contain` options
  * Throw errors at build and runtime if NO_NEW_PRIVS is not present and working
  * Reset umask to 0022 at start to corrrect several errors
  * Verify docker layers after download with sha256 checksum
  * Do not make excessive requests for auth tokens to docker registries
  * Fixed stripping whitespaces and empty new lines for the app commands (fix by 
    Rafal Gumienny, Biozentrum, Basel)
  * Improved the way that working directory is mounted 
  * Fixed an out of bounds array in src/lib/image/ext3/init.c

singularity-container (2.4.6-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fix for check_mounted() to check parent directories #1436
  * Free strdupped temporary variable in joinpath #1438

singularity-container (2.4.5-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Strip authorization header on http redirect to different domain when
    interacting with docker registries.

singularity-container (2.4.4-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * This is point release to correct an error with the last point release.  
  * Removed capability to handle docker layer aufs whiteout files correctly as
    it increased potential attack surface on some distros (with apologies to
    users who requestd it).

singularity-container (2.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Building an image is now more intuitive with the introduction of our build
    command. You don't need to worry about sizes or using create, or bootstrap
  * By default the build command now creates compressed read only containers
    using squashfs
  * Singularity now supports building additional base targets: local images,
    Singularity Hub, or the host operating system itself
  * A well documented solution for internal container modularity
    (http://containers-ftw.org/SCI-F/)
  * By popular demand and bribery, we are bringing back persistent instance
    support. You can now start up a container instance and using a given name,
    you can connect to that instance, and it keeps running even when you exit!
  * We are now using the network namespace to provide network isolation
  * Using a persistent overlay, you can modify a container image and all
    changes are written to the overlay layer
  * Cleanup and optimization of the Singularity image library

    import, copy, export, etc..).
  * Added ability to pull images from Singularity Hub and Docker
  * Containers now have labels, and are inspect'able
