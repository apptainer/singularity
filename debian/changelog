singularity-container (2.5.2-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Removed the option to use overlay images with `singularity mount`.  This
  * flaw could allow a malicious user accessing the host system to access
  * sensitive information when coupled with persistent ext3 overlay.
  * Fixed a race condition that might allow a malicious user to bypass 
    directory
  * image restrictions, like mounting the host root filesystem as a container
  * image
  * Fix an error in malloc allocation #1620
  * Honor debug flag when pulling from docker hub #1556
  * Fix a bug with passwd abort #1580
  * Allow user to override singularity.conf "mount home = no" with --home 
    option
  * #1496
  * Improve debugging output #1535
  * Fix some bugs in bind mounting #1525
  * Define PR_(S|G)ET_NO_NEW_PRIVS in user space so that these features will
  * work with kernels that implement them (like Cray systems) #1506
  * Create /dev/fd and standard streams symlinks in /dev when using minimal dev
  * mount or when specifying -c/-C/--contain option #1420
  * Fixed * expansion during app runscript creation #1486

singularity-container (2.5.1-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Corrected a permissions error when attempting to run Singularity from a
  * directory on NFS with root_squash enabled
  * Fixed a bug that closed a socket early, preventing correct container
  * execution on hosts using identity services like SSSD
  * Fixed a regression that broke the debootstrap agent

singularity-container (2.5.0-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Prevent a user from creating world writable files in root-owned directories 
    on the host system by manipulating symbolic links and bind mounts 
  * Prevent a user from creating folders outside of the container by 
    manipulating symbolic links in conjunction with the `--nv` option or by 
    bypassing check_mounted function with relative symlinks
  * Prevent a user from bypassing the `enable overlay = no` option in the 
    `singularity.conf` configuration file by setting an environment variable
  * Prevent a user from exploiting buffer overflows in `src/util/daemon.c` 
    and/or `src/lib/image/ext3/init.c` (reported by Erik Sjölund (DBB, 
    Stockholm University, Sweden))
  * Prevent a user from forging  of the pid_path to join any Singularity 
    namespace (reported by Erik Sjölund (DBB, Stockholm University, Sweden))
  * Restore docker-extract aufs whiteout handling that implements correct
    extraction of docker container layers. This adds libarchive-devel as a
    build time dep. At runtime libarchive is needed for whiteout handling. If
    libarchive is not available at runtime will fall back to previous
    extraction method.
  * Changed behavior of SINGULARITYENV_PATH to overwrite container PATH and
    added SINGULARITYENV_PREPEND_PATH and SINGULARITYENV_APPEND_PATH for users
    wanting to prepend or append to the container PATH at runtime
  * Support pulls from the NVIDIA cloud docker registry (fix by Justin Riley, 
    Harvard)
  * Close socket file descriptors in fd_cleanup
  * Fix conflict between `--nv` and `--contain` options
  * Throw errors at build and runtime if NO_NEW_PRIVS is not present and working
  * Reset umask to 0022 at start to corrrect several errors
  * Verify docker layers after download with sha256 checksum
  * Do not make excessive requests for auth tokens to docker registries
  * Fixed stripping whitespaces and empty new lines for the app commands (fix by 
    Rafal Gumienny, Biozentrum, Basel)
  * Improved the way that working directory is mounted 
  * Fixed an out of bounds array in src/lib/image/ext3/init.c

singularity-container (2.4.4-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * This is point release to correct an error with the last point release.

    users who requestd it).

singularity-container (2.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Building an image is now more intuitive with the introduction of our build
    command. You don't need to worry about sizes or using create, or bootstrap
  * By default the build command now creates compressed read only containers
    using squashfs
  * Singularity now supports building additional base targets: local images,
    Singularity Hub, or the host operating system itself
  * A well documented solution for internal container modularity
    (http://containers-ftw.org/SCI-F/)
  * By popular demand and bribery, we are bringing back persistent instance
    support. You can now start up a container instance and using a given name,
    you can connect to that instance, and it keeps running even when you exit!
  * We are now using the network namespace to provide network isolation
  * Using a persistent overlay, you can modify a container image and all
    changes are written to the overlay layer
  * Cleanup and optimization of the Singularity image library
