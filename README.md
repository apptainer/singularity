Singularity is an open source container platform designed to be simple, fast,
and secure. Singularity is optimized for compute focused enterprise and HPC
workloads, allowing untrusted users to run untrusted containers in a trusted
way.

Check out [talks about Singularity](https://singularity.hpcng.org/talks)
and some [use cases of Singularity](https://singularity.hpcng.org/usecases)
on our website.


## Getting Started with Singularity

To install Singularity from source, see the [installation
instructions](INSTALL.md). For other installation options, see [our
