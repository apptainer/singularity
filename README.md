SingularityCE is the Community Edition of Singularity, an open source container
platform designed to be simple, fast, and secure. Singularity is optimized
for compute focused enterprise and HPC workloads, allowing untrusted users
to run untrusted containers in a trusted way.

Check out [talks about Singularity](https://singularity.hpcng.org/videos)
and some [use cases of Singularity](https://singularity.hpcng.org/usecases)
on our website.

## Getting Started with SingularityCE

To install SingularityCE from source, see the [installation
instructions](INSTALL.md). For other installation options, see [our
guide](https://singularity.hpcng.org/admin-docs/master/installation.html).

System administrators can learn how to configure SingularityCE, and get an
overview of its architecture and security features in the [administrator
guide](https://singularity.hpcng.org/admin-docs/master/).

For users, see the [user
guide](https://singularity.hpcng.org/user-docs/master/) for details on how to use
and build Singularity containers.
