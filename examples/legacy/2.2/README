The example bootstrap definition files listed in this directory can be used
to create new container images on a variety of Linux distributions or become
the basis for customization to build reproducible containers for a specific
purpose.

If you wish to contribute a definition file, please send a pull request and
contribute it to the examples/contribs/ directory with the format being
hyphen ('-') delimited of the following format:

    1. Base distribution name and version if applicable (e.g. centos7 or
        ubuntu_trusty)
    2. Target nomenclature that describes the container (e.g. tensorflow)
    3. Any relevant version strings to the application or work-flow
    4. Always end in .def

An example of this:

    examples/contrib/debian84-tensorflow-0.10.def
