Description: Apptainer is a container platform.  It allows you to create and
 run containers that package up pieces of software in a way that is portable
 and reproducible.  You can build a container using Apptainer on your
 laptop, and then run it on many of the largest HPC clusters in the world,
 local university or company clusters, a single server, in the cloud, or on
 a workstation down the hall.  Your container is a single file, and you
 donâ€™t have to worry about how to install all the software you need on each
 different operating system.
