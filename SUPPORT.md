# SingularityCE Support

SingularityCE is a community focused open source project. We maintain
documentation, which everyone is welcome and encourage to contribute
to. We have a number of spaces in which questions can be asked, and
problems reported.

## Documentation

If you haven't already, read our
[documentation](https://www.sylabs.io/docs/). These docs cover common
use cases, and are often helpful to browse before submitting an issue
or asking a question to the community.

The documentation is under an open source license, and we encourage
everyone to contribute via the GitHub repositories.
  - [singularity-admindocs](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity-admindocs)
and
  - [singularity-userdocs](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity-userdocs)
repositories.

## Github

For bugs, feature requests, and other technical issues we recommend
opening a new issue on the Github issues boards.

 - [SingularityCE
   Issues](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/issues): is
   recommended for most issues with the SingularityiCE software itself.
 - [User
   Documentation](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity-userdocs/issues)
   questions, feedback, and suggestions should go here.
 - [Admin
   Documentation](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity-admindocs/issues)
   questions, feedback, and suggestions should go here.

Note that usage questions, or problems related to running a specific
piece of software in a container, are best asked on the Google Group,
or Slack channel. Questions in these venues will be seen by a greater
number of users, who may already know the answer!

### How should I create an issue?

After you identify a bug, or have an idea for a new feature, you
should search the issue board for similar problems reported
by other users. Another user may be facing the same issue, and you can
add a +1 (in message or icon) to indicate to the maintainers that the
issue is pressing for you as well. The squeaky wheel gets the grease!

### How is time allocated to addressing issues?

Like many open source projects, the majority of development work on
SingularityCE is carried out by maintainers and a small number of key
contributors. While we wish we could address every issue, there are
only so many hours in the day. We rank issues based on the following
questions:

 1. How many users are affected?
 2. Is there a proposed work-around?
 2. In how many instances does the proposed work-around fail?

With these simple questions, we can ensure that work is directed and
has the maximum impact! However, if your issue doesn't seem to be
getting attention you can still move it along using some of the
strategies discussed below.

### What if my issue goes stale?
Issues can go stale for a number of reasons. In the bullets below, we
will review some of these reasons, along with strategies for managing
them:

 1. *The issue needs a gentle reminder*. Try targeting a few people
    with a "`ping @username any thoughts about this?`" in the case
    that it was forgotten.
 2. *Was your issue properly explained*? You are much more likely to
    get help when you give clear instructions for reproducing the
    issue, and show effort on your part to think about what the
    problem might be. If possible, try to come up with a way to
    reproduce the issue that does not involve a special environment or
    exotic hardware.
 3. *Is there broad need*? It could be that your issue isn't having a
    big enough impact for other users to warrant the time for the
    small development team. In this case, you might try implementing a
    suggested fix, and then asking for help with the details.
 4. *Is your issue scattered?* When many issues pile up on boards, it
    sometimes is the case that issues are duplicated. It's important
    to find these duplicates and merge them into one, because in
    finding the duplicate you find another user to talk to about the
    issue.
 5. *Does your issue need to have scope?* The idea of scoping an issue
    means framing it with respect to other components of the
    software. For example, if you have a feature request to see
    metadata about an object, you might frame that in the context of
    container introspection, and suggest an addition to the software
    that fits with the "inspect" command. This kind of contribution is
    much more powerful than simply asking for something.
 6. *Consider contributing code* If you are able, opening a PR, even
    if it is imperfect or incomplete, can often provided the momentum
    needed to get a fix or enhancement rolling.
