// CreateContainer is called from master process to prepare container
// environment, e.g. perform mount operations, setup network, etc.
//
// Additional privileges required for setup may be gained when running
// in suid flow. However, when a user namespace is requested and it is not
// a hybrid workflow (e.g. fakeroot), then there is no privileged saved uid
// and thus no additional privileges can be gained.
//
// Specifically in singularity engine, additional privileges are gained during
// network setup (see container.prepareNetworkSetup) in fakeroot flow. The rest
// of the setup (e.g. mount operations) where privileges may be required is performed
// by calling RPC server methods (see internal/app/starter/rpc_linux.go for details).
