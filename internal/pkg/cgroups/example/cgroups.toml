# CPU resource restriction configuration
# - shares: CPU shares (relative weight (ratio) vs. other cgroups with cpu shares).
# - quotas: CPU hardcap limit (in usecs). Allowed cpu time in a given period.
# - period: CPU period to be used for hardcapping (in usecs).
# - realtimeRuntime: how much time realtime scheduling may use (in usecs).
# - realtimePeriod: CPU period to be used for realtime scheduling (in usecs).
# - cpus: CPUs to use within the cpuset. Default is to use any CPU available.
# - mems: list of memory nodes in the cpuset. Default is to use any available memory node
