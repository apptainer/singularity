# DEFAULT: @ALLOW_SETUID_DEFAULT@
# Should we allow users to utilize the setuid program flow within Singularity?
# note1: This is the default mode, and to utilize all features, this option

# note2: If this option is disabled, it will rely on the user namespace
# exclusively which has not been integrated equally between the different
# Linux distributions.

# ALLOW PID NS: [BOOL]
# DEFAULT: @ALLOW_PID_NS_DEFAULT@
