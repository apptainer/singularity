# SINGULARITY.CONF
# This is the global configuration file for Singularity. This file controls
# what the container is allowed to do on a particular host, and as a result
# this file must be owned by root.


# ALLOW SETUID: [BOOL]
# DEFAULT: @ALLOW_SETUID_DEFAULT@
# Should we allow users to utilize the setuid binary for launching singularity?
# The majority of features require this to be set to yes, but newer Fedora and
# Ubuntu kernels can provide limited functionality in unprivileged mode.

# MAX LOOP DEVICES: [INT]
# DEFAULT: @MAX_LOOP_DEVS_DEFAULT@

# DEFAULT: @ALLOW_PID_NS_DEFAULT@
# Should we allow users to request the PID namespace?

# CONFIG PASSWD: [BOOL]
# DEFAULT: @CONFIG_PASSWD_DEFAULT@
# If /etc/passwd exists within the container, this will automatically append
# an entry for the calling user.

# CONFIG GROUP: [BOOL]
# DEFAULT: @CONFIG_GROUP_DEFAULT@
# If /etc/group exists within the container, this will automatically append

# CONFIG RESOLV_CONF: [BOOL]

# MOUNT DEV: [yes/no/minimal]
# DEFAULT: @MOUNT_DEV_DEFAULT@
# Should we automatically bind mount /dev within the container? If you select
# minimal, and if overlay is enabled, then Singularity will attempt to create
# the following devices inside the container: null, zero, random, urandom
# note: This requires 'enable overlay = yes'
@MOUNT_DEV@ = @MOUNT_DEV_DEFAULT@


# MOUNT HOME: [BOOL]
# DEFAULT: @MOUNT_HOME_DEFAULT@
# Should we automatically determine the calling user's home directory and
# attempt to mount it's base path into the container? If the --contain option
# is used, the home directory will be created within the session directory or
# can be overridden with the SINGULARITY_HOME or SINGULARITY_WORKDIR
# environment variables (or their corresponding command line options).

# MOUNT TMP: [BOOL]
# DEFAULT: @MOUNT_TMP_DEFAULT@
# Should we automatically bind mount /tmp and /var/tmp into the container? If

# session directory or can be specified via the  SINGULARITY_WORKDIR
# environment variable (or the --workingdir command line option).

# BIND PATH: [STRING]
# DEFAULT: Undefined
# Define a list of files/directories that should be made available from within
# the container. The file or directory must exist within the container on
# which to attach to. you can specify a different source and destination
# path (respectively) with a colon; otherwise source and dest are the same.

# USER BIND CONTROL: [BOOL]
# DEFAULT: @USER_BIND_CONTROL_DEFAULT@

# control is only allowed if the host also supports PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS)
@USER_BIND_CONTROL@ = @USER_BIND_CONTROL_DEFAULT@


# ENABLE OVERLAY: [BOOL]
# DEFAULT: @ENABLE_OVERLAY_DEFAULT@

# that do not currently exist within the container. note: this only works when
# using the standard SUID mode (not user-namespaces)).

# MOUNT SLAVE: [BOOL]

# Should we automatically propagate file-system changes from the host?

# show up in the container.

# CONTAINER DIR: [STRING]

# LIMIT CONTAINER OWNERS: [STRING]
# DEFAULT: @LIMIT_CONTAINER_OWNERS_DEFAULT@
# Only allow containers to be used that are owned by a given user. If this

# LIMIT CONTAINER PATHS: [STRING]
# DEFAULT: @LIMIT_CONTAINER_PATHS_DEFAULT@

# feature only applies when Singularity is running in SUID mode and the user is
# non-root.

# SESSIONDIR PREFIX: [STRING]
# DEFAULT: @SESSIONDIR_PREFIX_DEFAULT@
# This specifies the prefix for the session directory. Appended to this string
# is an identification string unique to each user and container. Note, this
# location absolutely must be local on this host. If the default location of
# /tmp/ does not work for your system, /var/lib/singularity/sessions maybe a
# better option.

# SINGULARITY USER: [STRING]
# DEFAULT: @SINGULARITY_USER_DEFAULT@
# The protected image mode will restrict Singularity images to those owned by
# the 'singularity user'; this option allows admins to change the username we
# use as a test.
#
# If user namespaces are enabled, the singularity user setting is ignored and
# instead the invoking user is utilized for all access privilege checks.
