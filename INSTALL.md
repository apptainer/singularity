# Installing Singularity development-3.0

Since you are reading this from the Singualrity source code, it will be assumed 
that you are building/compiling. 

## Install system dependencies 
You must first install development and libraries to your host. Assuming Ubuntu 
(apply similar to RHEL derivatives):

```
$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y build-essential libssl-dev uuid-dev libgpgme11-dev
```

## Install golang
This is one of several ways to [install and configure golang](https://golang.org/doc/install).

First, visit the [golang download page](https://golang.org/dl/) and pick a 
package archive to download.  Copy the link address and download with `wget`.

```
$ export VERSION=1.10.2 OS=linux ARCH=amd64
$ cd /tmp
$ wget https://dl.google.com/go/go$VERSION.$OS-$ARCH.tar.gz
```

Then extract the archive to `/usr/local` (or use other instructions on go 
installation page).

```
$ sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go$VERSION.$OS-$ARCH.tar.gz
```

Finally, set up your environment for go

```
$ echo 'export GOPATH=${HOME}/go' >> ~/.bashrc
$ echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:${PATH}:${GOPATH}/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

## Clone the repo
golang is a bit finicky about where things are placed. Here is the correct way
to build Singularity from source.

```
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/singularityware
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/singularityware
$ git clone https://github.com/singularityware/singularity.git
$ cd singularity
$ git fetch
$ git checkout development-3.0
```

## Install golang dependencies 
Dependencies are managed using [`dep`](https://github.com/golang/dep). You can 
use `go get` to install it like so:

```
$ go get -u -v github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep
```

And then you can install the golang dependencies as part of the build later on or like so:

```
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/singularityware/singularity
$ dep ensure -v
```

## Compile the Singularity binary
Now you are ready to build Singularity:

```
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/singularityware/singularity
$ ./mconfig
$ cd ./builddir
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

To build in a different folder and to set the install prefix to a different path:

```
$ ./mconfig -p /usr/local -b ./buildtree
```
