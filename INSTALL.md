# Installing SingularityCE

**NOTE:** *This installation guide has been updated for the release candidate of
SingularityCE 3.8.0. The `3.8.0-rc1` version that will be installed is a
pre-release of SingularityCE. To install the latest stable version,
substitute the version `3.7.3` in the instructions below. See the `release-3.7` branch for the current stable codebase.*

Since you are reading this from the SingularityCE source code, it will be assumed
that you are building/compiling from source.

installing pre-built EPEL packages etc. please check the

## Install system dependencies

You must first install development tools and libraries to your host.
On Debian-based systems:

```
$ sudo apt-get update && \
  sudo apt-get install -y build-essential \
  libseccomp-dev pkg-config squashfs-tools cryptsetup
```

On CentOS/RHEL:

```
$ sudo yum groupinstall -y 'Development Tools' && \
  sudo yum install -y epel-release && \
  sudo yum install -y golang libseccomp-devel \
  squashfs-tools cryptsetup
```

## Install Golang

This is one of several ways to [install and configure golang](https://golang.org/doc/install).
The CentOS/RHEL instructions above already installed it so this method is not needed there.

First, download the Golang archive to `/tmp`, then extract the archive to `/usr/local`.

_**NOTE:** if you are updating Go from a older version, make sure you remove `/usr/local/go` before
reinstalling it._

```
$ export VERSION=1.16.4 OS=linux ARCH=amd64  # change this as you need

$ wget -O /tmp/go${VERSION}.${OS}-${ARCH}.tar.gz https://dl.google.com/go/go${VERSION}.${OS}-${ARCH}.tar.gz && \
  sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf /tmp/go${VERSION}.${OS}-${ARCH}.tar.gz
```

Finally, set up your environment for Go:

```
$ echo 'export GOPATH=${HOME}/go' >> ~/.bashrc && \
  echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:${PATH}:${GOPATH}/bin' >> ~/.bashrc && \
  source ~/.bashrc
```

## Install golangci-lint

This is an optional (but highly recommended!) step. To ensure
consistency and to catch certain kinds of issues early, we provide a
configuration file for `golangci-lint`. Every pull request must pass the
checks specified there, and these will be run automatically before
attempting to merge the code. If you are modifying Singularity and
contributing your changes to the repository, it's faster to run these
checks locally before uploading your pull request.

In order to download and install the latest version of `golangci-lint`,
you can run:

```sh
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangci/golangci-lint/master/install.sh | sh -s -- -b $(go env GOPATH)/bin
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
$ curl -sfL https://install.goreleaser.com/github.com/golangci/golangci-lint.sh |
  sh -s -- -b $(go env GOPATH)/bin v1.31.0
```

This will download and install golangci-lint from its Github releases
page (using version v1.31.0 at the moment).

## Clone the repo

Golang is a bit finicky about where things are placed. Here is the correct way
to build Singularity from source:

```
$ mkdir -p ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/hpcng && \
  cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/hpcng && \
  git clone https://github.com/hpcng/singularity.git && \
  cd singularity
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
To build a stable version of Singularity, check out a [release tag](https://github.com/hpcng/singularity/tags) before compiling:

```
$ git checkout v3.8.0
=======
To build a specific version of SingularityCE, check out a [release tag](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/tags) before compiling:

```
$ git checkout v3.8.0-rc.1
>>>>>>> sylabs41-2
```

## Compiling SingularityCE

You can build SingularityCE using the following commands:

```
$ cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/hpcng/singularity && \
  ./mconfig && \
  cd ./builddir && \
  make && \
  sudo make install
```

And that's it! Now you can check your SingularityCE version by running:

```
$ singularity version
```
To build in a different folder and to set the install prefix to a different path:

```
$ ./mconfig -b ./buildtree -p /usr/local
```

## Install from the RPM

*NOTE: You should only attempt to build the RPM on a CentOS/RHEL system.*

To build the RPM, you first need to install `rpm-build` and `wget`:

```
$ sudo yum -y update && sudo yum install -y rpm-build wget
```

Make sure you have also 
[installed the system dependencies](#install-system-dependencies)
as shown above.  Then download the latest 
[release tarball](https://github.com/hpcng/singularity/releases)
and use it to install the RPM like this: 

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
$ export VERSION=3.8.0  # this is the singularity version, change as you need

$ wget https://github.com/hpcng/singularity/releases/download/v${VERSION}/singularity-${VERSION}.tar.gz && \
    rpmbuild -tb singularity-${VERSION}.tar.gz && \
    sudo rpm -ivh ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/singularity-${VERSION}-1.el7.x86_64.rpm && \
    rm -rf ~/rpmbuild singularity-${VERSION}*.tar.gz
=======
$ export VERSION=3.8.0-rc.1  # this is the singularity version, change as you need

$ wget https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/releases/download/v${VERSION}/singularity-ce-${VERSION}.tar.gz && \
    rpmbuild -tb singularity-ce-${VERSION}.tar.gz && \
    sudo rpm -ivh ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/singularity-ce-${VERSION}-1.el7.x86_64.rpm && \
    rm -rf ~/rpmbuild singularity-ce-${VERSION}*.tar.gz
>>>>>>> sylabs41-2
```

Alternatively, to build an RPM from the latest master you can 
[clone the repo as detailed above](#clone-the-repo).  Then create your own
tarball and use it to install Singularity:

```
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hpcng/singularity && \
  ./mconfig && \
  make -C builddir rpm && \
<<<<<<< HEAD
  sudo rpm -ivh ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/singularity-3.8.0*.x86_64.rpm # or whatever version you built
=======
  sudo rpm -ivh ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/singularity-ce-3.8.0*.x86_64.rpm # or whatever version you built
>>>>>>> sylabs41-2
```

To build an rpm with an alternative install prefix set RPMPREFIX on the
make step, for example:

```
$ make -C builddir rpm RPMPREFIX=/usr/local
```
