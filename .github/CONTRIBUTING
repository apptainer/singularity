## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before doing a build to test your PR locally.
2. For any new functionality, please write a test to be added to Continuous Integration (Travis) to test it.
3. All (major) changes to Singularity must be documented on [singularityware.github.io](https://singularityware.github.io).
   If your PR changes a core functionality, please include clear description of the changes in your PR
   so that the docs can be updated, or better, submit a sister PR to update the docs directly.
4. If necessary, update the README.md, and check the `*.help` scripts under [libexec/cli](libexec/cli). 
   that provide the command line helper output. 
5. Is there enough documentation in your code so a human can understand how it works? This includes 
   description of environmental variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
6. Include in your PR the (intended) version of Singularity that this change is intended for.
7. The pull request will be reviewed by others, and the final merge must be done by the admin of
   the repo and main developer of Singularity, @gmkurtzer.
