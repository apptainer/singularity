<h1>Contributing to Singularity</h1>
<p>
We are always interested in having help! If you want to join the party, there
are several areas you can help!
</p>


<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>
We (like almost all open source software providers) have a documentation
dillemma... We tend to focus on the code features and functionality before
working on documentation. And there is very good reason for this, we want to
share the love so nobody feels left out!
</p>
<p>
To contribute to the web based documentation, you should obtain a GitHub
account and fork the Singularity repository. Once forked, change to the
'gh-pages' branch and check out the 'content/' directory. In there you will
find all of the base HTML files for all of the pages. You will only need
to write the page HTML because each file will automatically be included into
the page template by javascript functions (examples of javascript links can
be seen in the existing pages).
</p>
<p>
There is also a strong desire to write a user manual for Singularity, so if
this is something you are interested in, please join the
<a href='https://groups.google.com/a/lbl.gov/forum/#!forum/singularity'>Google Group</a>
and let us know!
</p>

<h2>Support, helping and spreading the word!</h2>
<p>
This is a huge endavor, and it is greatly appreciated! If you have been using
Singularity and having good luck with it, join our
<a href='https://groups.google.com/a/lbl.gov/forum/#!forum/singularity'>Google Group</a>
and help out other users! Post to online communities about Singularity, and
request that your distribution vendor, service provider, and system
administrators include Singularity for you!
</p>
