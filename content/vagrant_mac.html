<h1>Running Singularity on a Mac with Vagrant</h1>
<p>
This recipe demonstrates how to run Singularity on your Mac via Vagrant and
Ubuntu. The recipe requires access to 'brew' which is a package installation
subsystem for OS X. This recipe may take anywhere from 5-20 minutes to
complete.

<pre class="padPre text-justify">
# This installs Brew if you do not have it installed already
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

# The next commands will install Vagrant and the necessary bits
brew cask install virtualbox
brew cask install vagrant
brew cask install vagrant-manager

# Create a working directory for the Vagrant configuration and
# generate a template Vagrantfile for "ubuntu/trusty64"
mkdir singularity-vm
cd singularity-vm
vagrant init ubuntu/trusty64

# Build and start the Vagrant hosted VM
vagrant up --provider virtualbox

# Run the necessary commands within the VM to install Singularity
vagrant ssh -c /bin/sh &lt;&lt;EOF
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get -y install build-essential curl git sudo man vim autoconf libtool
    git clone https://github.com/gmkurtzer/singularity.git
    cd singularity
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
    make
    sudo make install
EOF

# Singularity is installed in your Vagrant Ubuntu VM! Now you can
# use Singularity as you would normally by logging into the VM
# directly
vagrant ssh

</pre>
</p>
<p>
Remember that the VM is running in the background because we started
it via the command 'vagrant up'. You can shut the VM down using the
command 'vagrant halt' when you no longer need it.
