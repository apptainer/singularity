<h1>The Singularity configuration file</h1>
<br/>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The Singularity configuration file is installed into the defined configure
argument --sysconfdir, --prefix, or automatically configured if you are
installing via a package (such as RPM or DEB) in which case it is usually
installed to <b>/etc/singularity/singularity.conf</b>.
</p>
<p>
For security reasons, the configuration file MUST be owned by root! This
is because Singularity leverages some privileged features along its
programmatic work-flow, with most of these features being toggle-able via
the config file. Forcing the ownership of the configuration file to be
root ensures that the system administrators get the final say as to what
Singularity features are to be allowed.
</p>

<h2>Options and formats</h2>
<p>
The Following configuration file keywords and values are supported. There
are two configuration key/value types supported:
<ul class="list-unstyled">
<li><b>Boolean</b>: Configuration entries that are boolean are set or
unset by either "yes" or "no" with the default being entry specific.</li>
<li><b>String</b>: Configuration entries that are string will be free
form to the end of the line. No multi-line values are supported nor
are quotations or escapes.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>

<h4>allow pid ns</h4> (boolean, default=yes)
<p>
Should Singularity support separation of the NEWPID/PID namespaces? This
is important because some resource managers that are not utilizing CGroups
may not be able to limit resource consumption (using ulimits) when
processes are running under a different namespace.
</p>

<h4>mount proc</h4> (boolean, default=yes)
<p>
Should /proc be mounted within the container environments?
</p>

<h4>mount sys</h4> (boolean, default=yes)
<p>
Should /sys be mounted within the container environments?
</p>

<h4>bind path</h4> (string)
<p>
Define a list of files or directories that should be made available within
a container environment. The file or directory given *must* exist on both
the host and the container to properly bind. The format of this argument
can be either a single path which makes the assumption that both the
source and destination paths are the same, or two paths comma delimited
with the source path being first, and the destination path being second.
You can supply any number of 'bind path' entries in your configuration
file.
</p>

<h4>config passwd</h4> (boolean, default=yes)
<p>
If the /etc/passwd file exists within the container, this function will
make a volatile copy of the file and append the appropriate information
for the calling user (if not root) and then bind it back into the
container.
</p>

<h4>config group</h4> (boolean, default=yes)
<p>
If the /etc/group file exists within the container, this function will
make a volatile copy of the file and append the appropriate information
for the calling user (if not root) and then bind it back into the
container.  (options: yes/no, default=yes)
</p>
