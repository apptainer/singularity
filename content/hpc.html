<h1>Singularity on HPC</h1>
<p>
One of the architecturally defined features in Singularity is that it can execute
containers like they are native programs or scripts on a host computer. As a
result, integration with schedulers is simple and runs exactly as you would
expect. All standard input, output, error, pipes, IPC, and other communication
pathways that locally running programs employ are synchronized with the applications
running locally within the container.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, because Singularity is not emulating a full hardware level
virtualization paradigm, there is no need to separate out any sandboxed networks
or file systems because there is no concept of user-escalation within a container.
Users can run Singularity containers just as they run any other program on the
HPC resource.
</p>
<p>
Another result of the Singularity architecture is the ability to properly integrate
with the Message Passing Interface (MPI). Work has already been done for out of the
box compatibility with Open MPI (both in Open MPI v2.x as well as part of
Singularity). Here is a document that illustrates the Open MPI/Singularity workflow:

<p>
From the above image you can follow the invocation pathway:
<ol>
<li>mpirun is called by the resource manager or the user directly from a shell</li>
<li>Open MPI then calls the process management daemon (ORTED)</li>
<li>The ORTED process launches the Singularity container requested by the mpirun command</li>
<li>Singularity builds the container and namespace environment</li>
<li>Singularity then launches the MPI application within the container</li>
<li>The MPI application launches and loads the Open MPI libraries</li>
<li>The Open MPI libraries connect back to the ORTED process via the Process Management Interface (PMI)</li>
</ol>
At this point the processes within the container run as they would normally directly
on the host at full bandwidth! This entire process happens behind the scenes, and
from the user's perspective running via MPI is as simple as just calling mpirun on
the host as they would normally.

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>
Below is an example snippet of building and installing OpenMPI into a container
and then running an example MPI program through Singularity.
<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
<pre>
$ # Include the appropriate development tools into the container (notice we are calling
$ # singularity as root and the container is writeable)
$ sudo singularity exec -w /tmp/Centos-7.img yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
$
$ # Clone the OpenMPI GitHub master branch in current directory (on host)
$ git clone https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi.git
$ cd ompi
$
$ # Build OpenMPI in the working directory, using the tool chain within the container
$ singularity exec /tmp/Centos-7.img ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
$ singularity exec /tmp/Centos-7.img make
$
$ # Install OpenMPI into the container (notice now running as root and container is writeable)
$ sudo singularity exec -w /tmp/Centos-7.img make install
$
$ # Build the OpenMPI ring example and place the binary in this directory
$ singularity exec /tmp/Centos-7.img mpicc examples/ring_c.c -o ring
$
$ # Install the MPI binary into the container at /usr/bin/ring
$ sudo singularity copy /tmp/Centos-7.img ./ring /usr/bin/
$
$ # Run the MPI program within the container by calling the MPIRUN on the host
$ mpirun -np 20 singularity exec /tmp/Centos-7.img /usr/bin/ring

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>
<h4>Supported Open MPI Version(s):</h4>
To achieve proper container'ized Open MPI support, you must use Open MPI
version 2.1 which at the time of this writing has not been released yet.
The above example builds from the current master development branch of Open
MPI.
