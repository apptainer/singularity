<h1>Singularity Images</h1>
<p>
Singularity images are single files which physically contain the container.
Singularity images are 'sparse' files in that they start off with a giant hole
and thus it does not consume disk space until you fill the hole (e.g. a 1GiB
image may start off only taking about 30MiB of physical disk space). As you fill
the image by installing files, data, and programs into it you will find it
increase in size.
</p>
<p>
The effect of all files existing virtually within a single image greatly
simplifies sharing, copying, branching, and other management tasks. It also
means that standard file system ACLs apply to access and permission to the
container (e.g. I can give read only access to a colleague, or block access
completely with a simple chmod command).
</p>

<h2>Creating a new blank Singularity container image</h2>
<p>
Singularity will create a default container image of 1GiB using the following
command example:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="padPre text-justify">
$ sudo singularity create container.img
Creating a sparse image with a maximum size of 1024MiB...
Formatting image (/sbin/mkfs.ext4)
Done. Image can be found at: container.img
$ ls -l container.img 
-rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 1073741856 Jun  1 08:27 container.img
$ du -sh container.img 
33M     container.img
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Here we created a new container image called 'container.img' in the current
directory. You can see the the 'ls' command reports it is 1GiB in size, but when
checking the actual disk usage, it reports only 33MiB. As we add files to the
image, its actual disk usage will increase.
</p>

<p>
Also, notice the permissions of the container image as it is executable. This
is important in that Singularity images can be executed directly (as long as
Singularity is installed on the host system).
</p>

<p>
You can increase or change the default image size using the --size option to
create (option ordering is very important with Singularity and it must follow
the 'create' sub-command).
</p>

<h2>Mounting an image</h2>
<p>
Once the image has been created, you can mount it with the following command:

<pre class="padPre text-justify">
$ sudo singularity mount container.img /mnt

Mounting image 'container.img' into '/mnt'

To unmount, simply exit this new shell.

container.img:/mnt&gt; df -h /mnt
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/loop0      976M  2.6M  907M   1% /mnt
container.img:/mnt&gt; exit
$ 
</pre>

When mounting the image in this manner, Singularity makes use of name-spaces such
that the mount is only visible and accessible from within the current shell that
Singularity will spawn. When you are finished, you can simply exit the shell and
the file system will be automatically unmounted.
</p>

<h2>Increasing the size of an existing image</h2>
<p>
You can increase the size of an image after it has been instantiated by using the
'expand' Singularity sub-command as follows:
</p>

<pre class="padPre text-justify">
$ sudo singularity expand container.img 
Expanding sparse image by 512MiB...
Checking image (/sbin/mkfs.ext4)
e2fsck 1.42.9 (28-Dec-2013)
Growing file system
resize2fs 1.42.9 (28-Dec-2013)
Done. Image can be found at: container.img
$ ls -l container.img 
-rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 1610612769 Jun  1 08:40 container.img
</pre>

<p>
Similar to the create sub-command, you can override the default size (which is
512MiB) by using the --size option.
</p>

<h2>Copying, sharing, branching, and distributing your image</h2>
<p>
Because Singularity images are single files, they are easily copied and managed.
You can copy the image to create a branch, share the image and distribute the
image as easily as copying any other file you control!
</p>
<p>
The primary motivation of Singularity is mobility, the single file image format
makes this a simple accomplishment.
</p>

<h2>Read Only Vs. Read Write</h2>
<p>
By default, all Singularity commands that operate within a container (e.g.
'exec', 'run', and 'shell') all enter the image by default as read only. This
enables multiple processes to be able to use the image appropriately (as would
be necessary with MPI). But if you want to make any changes to the image, you
must have both write permission on the image file itself and use the 
'--writable' flag. For example:
<pre class="padPre text-justify">
$ sudo singularity shell container.img 
Singularity/container.img&gt; whoami
root
Singularity/container.img&gt; touch /foo
touch: cannot touch '/foo': Read-only file system
Singularity/container.img&gt; exit
$ sudo singularity shell --writable container.img 
Singularity/container.img&gt; touch /foo
Singularity/container.img&gt; exit
$ 
</pre>
Even though I was root in both cases, I could not touch /foo unless the
shell sub-command was called with the '--writable' flag.
</p>
