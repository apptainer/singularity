<h1>Environment</h1>
<br/>
<h2>Directory access</h2>
<p>
By default Singularity tries to create a seamless user experience between
the host and the container. To do this, Singularity makes various locations
accessible within the container automatically. For example, the user's
home directory is always bound into the container as is /tmp and /var/tmp.
Additionally your current working directory (cwd/pwd) is also bound into
the container iff it is not an operating system directory or already
accessible via another mount. For almost all cases, this will work
flawlessly as follows:
<pre class="padPre text-justify">
$ pwd
/home/gmk/demo
$ singularity shell container.img 
Singularity/container.img&gt; pwd
/home/gmk/demo
Singularity/container.img&gt; ls -l debian.def 
-rw-rw-r--. 1 gmk gmk 125 May 28 10:35 debian.def
Singularity/container.img&gt; exit
$ 
</pre>
</p>
<p>
For directory binds to function properly, there must be an existing target
endpoint within the container (just like a mount point). This means that if
your home directory exists in a non-standard base directory like
"/foobar/username" then the base directory "/foobar" must already exist
within the container.
</p>
<p>
Singularity will not create these base directories! You must enter the
container with the --writable option being set, and create the directory
manually.
</p>

<h2>Current Working Directory</h2>
<p>
Singularity will try to replicate your current working directory within the
container. Sometimes this is straight forward and possible, other times it
is not (e.g. if the base dir of your current working directory does not
exist). In that case, Singularity will retain the file descriptor to your
current directory and change you back to it. If you do a 'pwd' within the
container, you may see some weird things. For example:
<pre class="padPre text-justify">
$ pwd
/foobar
$ ls -l
total 0
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 0 Jun  1 11:32 mooooo
$ singularity shell ~/demo/container.img 
WARNING: CWD bind directory not present: /foobar
Singularity/container.img&gt; pwd
(unreachable)/foobar
Singularity/container.img&gt; ls -l
total 0
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 0 Jun  1 18:32 mooooo
Singularity/container.img&gt; exit
$ 
</pre>
But notice how even though the directory location is not resolvable, the
directory contents are available.
</p>

<h2>Standard IO and pipes</h2>
<p>
Singularity automatically sends and receives all standard IO from the host
to the applications within the container to facilitate expected behavior
from the interaction between the host and the container. For example:
<pre class="padPre text-justify">
$ cat debian.def | singularity exec container.img grep 'MirrorURL'
MirrorURL "http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/"
$ 
</pre>

</p>

<h2>Making changes to the container (writable)</h2>
<p>
By default, containers are accessed as read only. This is both to enable
parallel container execution (e.g. MPI). To enter a container using
exec, run, or shell you must pass the --writable flag in order to open
the image as read/writable.
</p>

<h2>Containing the container</h2>
<p>
By providing the argument --contain to exec, run or shell you will find
that shared directories are no longer shared. For example, the user's
home directory is writable, but it is non-persistent between
non-overlapping runs.
