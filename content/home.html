<br/>
Application containers enabling mobility of compute
<br/>&nbsp;<br/>

<h3>HPC centers, users, and admins need application focused containers to
support portable workflows!</h3>
<p>
Containers are proving to be an extremly valuable technology for science;
Singularity focuses container approaches, workflows, and methods to create
portable environments enabling computational science!
</p>
<p>
Singularity does this by enabling several key facets:

<h4>Encapsulation of the environment</h4>
<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
<p>
Mobility of Compute is the encapsulation of an environment in such a
manner to make it portable between systems. This operating system
environment can contain the necessary applications for a particular
work-flow, development tools, and/or raw data. Once this environment has
been developed it can be easily copied and run from any other Linux
system.
</p>
<p>
This allows users to BYOE (Bring Their Own Environment) and work within
that environment anywhere that Singularity is installed. From a service
provider's perspective we can easily allow users the flexibility of
"cloud"-like environments enabling custom requirements and workflows.
</p>
<p>
Additionally there is always a misalignment between development and production
environments. The service provider can only offer a stable, secure tuned
production environment which in many times will not keep up with the fast
paced requirements of developers. With Singularity, you can control your own
development environment and simply copy them to the production resources.

<div id="image" class="popup-background">

<h4>Containers are image based</h4>
<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
<p>
Using images have several key benefits:
</p>
<p>
First, this image serves as a vector for mobility while retaining permissions
of the files within the image. For example, a user may own the image file so
they can copy the image to and from system to system. But, files within an
image must be owned by the appropriate user. For example, '/etc/passwd' and
'/' must be owned by root to achieve appropriate access permission. These
permissions are maintained within a user owned image.
</p>
<p>
There is never a need to build, rebuild, or cache an image! All IO happens
on an as needed basis. The overhead in starting a container is in the
thousandanths of a second because there is never a need to pull, build or
cache anything!
</p>
<p>
On HPC systems a single image file optimizes the benefits of a shared parallel
file system! There is a single metadata lookup for the image itself, and the
subsequent IO is all directed to the storage servers themselves. Compare this
to the massive amount of metadata IO that would be required if the container's
root file system was in a directory structure. It is not uncommon for large
Python jobs to DDOS (distributed denial of service) a parallel meta-data server
for minutes! The Singularity image mitigates this considerably.

<div id="rootless" class="popup-background">
<div class="popup-content">
<h4>No user contextual changes or root escalation allowed</h4>
<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
<p>
When Singularity is executed, the calling user is maintained within the
container. For example, if user 'gmk' starts a Singularity container,
the same user 'gmk' will end up within the container. If 'root' starts the
container, 'root' will be the user inside the container.
</p>
<p>
Singularity also limits a user's ability to escalate privileges within the
container. Even if the user works in their own environmnet where they
configured 'sudo' or even removed root's password, they will not be able
to 'sudo' or 'su' to root. If you want to be root inside the container,
you must first be root outside the container.
</p>
<p>
Because of this model, it becomes possible to blur the line of access
between what is contained and what is on the host as Singularity does not
grant the user any more access then they already have. It also enables
the implementation on shared/multi-tenant resources.

<div id="daemonless" class="popup-background">
<div class="popup-content">
<h4>No root owned daemon processes</h4>
<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
<p>
Singularity does not utilize a daemon process to manage the containers. While
daemon processes do facilitate certain types of workflows and privilege
escalation, it breaks all resource controlled environments. This is because
a user's job becomes a subprocess of the daemon (rather then the user's shell)
and the daemon process is outside of the reach of a resource manager or batch
scheduler.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, securing a root owned daemon process which is designed to
manipulate the host's environment becomes tricky. In currently implemented
models, it is possible to grant permissions to users to control the daemon,
or not. There is no sense of ACL's or access of what users can and can not do.
</p>
<p>
While there are some other container implementations that do not leverage a
daemon, they lack other features necessary to be considered as reasonable
user facing solution without having root access. For example, there has been
a standing unimplemented patch to RunC (already daemon-less) which allows for
root-less usage (no root). But, user contexts are not maintained, and it will
only work with chroot directories (instead of an image) where files must be
owned and manipulated by the root user!
