    <h3>Application containers enabling mobility of compute</h3>

    <h2>HPC centers, users, and admins need to support portable workflows!</h2>
    Containers are proving to be an extremly valuable technology for science;
    Singularity focuses container approaches, workflows, and methods to create
    portable environments enabling computational science!
    </p>
    <p>
    Singularity does this by enabling several key facets:
    <ul class="list-unstyled">
    <li>
    <a href="#env_encapsulation" data-toggle="collapse">
    Encapsulation of the environment
    </a>
    </li>
    <div id="env_encapsulation" class="collapse dpdiv">
    <p>
    Mobility of Compute is the encapsulation of an environment in such a
    manner to make it portable between systems. This operating system
    environment can contain the necessary applications for a particular
    work-flow, development tools, and/or raw data. Once this environment has
    been developed it can be easily copied and run from any other Linux
    system.
    </p>
    <p>
    This allows users to BYOE (Bring Their Own Environment) and work within
    that environment anywhere that Singularity is installed. From a service
    provider's perspective we can easily allow users the flexibility of
    "cloud"-like environments enabling custom requirements and workflows.
    </p>
    <p>
    Additionally there is always a misalignment between development and production
    environments. The service provider can only offer a stable, secure tuned
    production environment which in many times will not keep up with the fast
    paced requirements of developers. With Singularity, you can control your own
    development environment and simply copy them to the production resources.
    </p>
    </div><!--env_encapsulation-->
    <li>
    <a href="#image" data-toggle="collapse">
    Containers are image based
    </a>
    </li>
    <div id="image" class="collapse dpdiv">
    <p>
    Using images have several key benefits:
    </p>
    <p>
    First, this image serves as a vector for mobility while retaining permissions
    of the files within the image. For example, a user may own the image file so
    they can copy the image to and from system to system. But, files within an
    image must be owned by the appropriate user. For example, '/etc/passwd' and
    '/' must be owned by root to achieve appropriate access permission. These
    permissions are maintained within a user owned image.
    </p>
    <p>
    There is never a need to build, rebuild, or cache an image! All IO happens
    on an as needed basis. The overhead in starting a container is in the
    thousandanths of a second because there is never a need to pull, build or
    cache anything!
    </p>
    <p>
    On HPC systems a single image file optimizes the benefits of a shared parallel
    file system! There is a single metadata lookup for the image itself, and the
    subsequent IO is all directed to the storage servers themselves. Compare this
    to the massive amount of metadata IO that would be required if the container's
    root file system was in a directory structure. It is not uncommon for large
    Python jobs to DDOS (distributed denial of service) a parallel meta-data server
    for minutes! The Singularity image mitigates this considerably.
    </p>
    </div><!--image-->

    <li>
    <a href="#rootless" data-toggle="collapse">
    No user contextual changes or root escalation allowed
    </a>
    </li>
    <div id="rootless" class="collapse dpdiv">
    <p>
    When Singularity is executed, the calling user is maintained within the
    container. For example, if user 'gmk' starts a Singularity container,
    the same user 'gmk' will end up within the container. If 'root' starts the
    container, 'root' will be the user inside the container.
    </p>
    <p>
    Singularity also limits a user's ability to escalate privileges within the
    container. Even if the user works in their own environment where they
    configured 'sudo' or even removed root's password, they will not be able
    to 'sudo' or 'su' to root. If you want to be root inside the container,
    you must first be root outside the container.
    </p>
    <p>
    Because of this model, it becomes possible to blur the line of access
    between what is contained and what is on the host as Singularity does not
    grant the user any more access then they already have. It also enables
    the implementation on shared/multi-tenant resources.
    </p>
    </div><!--rootless-->

    <li>
    <a href="#daemonless" data-toggle="collapse">
    No root owned daemon processes
    </a>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <div id="daemonless" class="collapse dpdiv">
    <p>
    Singularity does not utilize a daemon process to manage the containers. While
    daemon processes do facilitate certain types of workflows and privilege
    escalation, it breaks all resource controlled environments. This is because
    a user's job becomes a subprocess of the daemon (rather then the user's shell)
    and the daemon process is outside of the reach of a resource manager or batch
    scheduler.
    </p>
    <p>
    Additionally, securing a root owned daemon process which is designed to
    manipulate the host's environment becomes tricky. In currently implemented
    models, it is possible to grant permissions to users to control the daemon,
    or not. There is no sense of ACL's or access of what users can and can not do.
    </p>
    <p>
    While there are some other container implementations that do not leverage a
    daemon, they lack other features necessary to be considered as reasonable
    user facing solution without having root access. For example, there has been
    a standing unimplemented patch to RunC (already daemon-less) which allows for
    root-less usage (no root). But, user contexts are not maintained, and it will
    only work with chroot directories (instead of an image) where files must be
    owned and manipulated by the root user!
