<h4 class="loud">BYOE: Bring Your Own Environment!</h4>
<p>

Engineering work-flows for research computing can be a complicated and
iterative process, and even more so on a shared and somewhat inflexible
production environment. Singularity solves this problem by making the
environment flexible.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, it is common (especially in education) for schools to provide a
standardized pre-configured Linux distribution to the students which includes
all of the necessary tools, programs, and configurations so they can
immediately follow along.
</p>

<h4 class="loud">Reproducible science</h4>
<p>

Singularity containers can be built to include all of the programs, libraries,
data and scripts such that an entire demonstration can be contained and either
archived or distributed for others to replicate no matter what version of Linux
they are presently running.
</p>

<h4 class="loud">Commercially supported code requiring a particular environment</h4>
<p>
Some commercial applications are only certified to run on particular versions
of Linux. If that application was installed into a Singularity container running
the version of Linux that it is certified for, that container could run on any
Linux host. The application environment, libraries, and certified stack would all
continue to run exactly as it is intended.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, Singularity blurs the line between container and host such that 
your home directory (and other directories) exist within the container.
Applications within the container have full and direct access to all files you
own thus you can easily incorporate the contained commercial application into
your work and process flow on the host.
</p>

<h4 class="loud">Static environments (software appliances)</h4>
<p>

Fund once, update never software development model. While this is not ideal, it
is a common scenario for research funding. A certain amount of money is granted
for initial development, and once that has been done the interns, grad students,
post-docs, or developers are reassigned to other projects. This leaves the
software stack un-maintained, and even rebuilds for updated compilers or Linux
distributions can not be done without unfunded effort.
</p>

<h4 class="loud">Legacy code on old operating systems</h4>
<p>

Similar to the above example, while this is less than ideal it is a fact of the
research ecosystem. As an example, I know of one Linux distribution which has
been end of life for 15 years which is still in production due to the software
stack which is custom built for this environment. Singularity has no problem
running that operating system and application stack on a current operating
system and hardware.
</p>

<h4 class="loud">Complicated software stacks that are very host specific</h4>
<p>

There are various software packages which are so complicated that it takes much
effort in order to port, update and qualify to new operating systems or
compilers. The atmospheric and weather applications are a good example of this.
Porting them to a contained operating system will prolong the use-fullness of
the development effort considerably.
</p>

<h4 class="loud">Complicated work-flows that require custom installation and/or data</h4>
<p>

Consolidating a work-flow into a Singularity container simplifies distribution
and replication of scientific results. Making containers available along with
published work enables other scientists to build upon (and verify) previous
scientific work.
