<h1>Singularity Security Overview</h1>
<p>
While all container systems have security concerns, Singularity
approaches the container paradigm differently to make it even
suitable for shared multi-tenant large environments.
</p>
<h2>General container requirements</h2>
<p>
When people speak about containers, they are generally talking about a few
things, name-spaces and alternate root file systems. These underlying
features are provided by most current Linux distributions but they require
root privileges in order to work properly.
</p>
<p>
Generally, if the desired requirement is "containers" featuring user
provided operating systems, somewhere along the invocation pathway root
privileges are necessary.
</p>
<h2>How do container systems work as users</h2>
<p>
Generally speaking a container system will do one of three things:
<ol>
<li>
As mentioned above, the CLONE_NEWUSER name-space allows some container
functionality, but not enough for what Singularity targets as the base
use-cases.
</li>
<li>
The container system will run a root owned daemon process. This daemon
process will have a communication pathway that will allow non-root users
to control it. Docker by default uses a local Unix domain socket so
users can control the Docker daemon. In this case, the root owned daemon
process must be carefully designed to support user ACLs, be privilege
aware, and limit functionalists that could be used as an attack vector.
</li>
<li>
Singularity accomplishes the privilege necessity by invoking a root SUID
portion of the work-flow. This allows Singularity to carefully decide when
to escalate privileges and when to drop them. It also allows Singularity
to run daemon free which facilitates scheduling and resource management
complexities as well as keeps the code easily audit-able.
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h2>What security mitigations does Singularity employ</h2>
<p>
SUID programs are common targets for attackers because they provide a
direct mechanism to gain privileged command execution. These are some of
the baseline security mitigations for Singularity:
<ol>
<li>Keep the escalated bits within the code as simple and transparent so it can be easily audit-able</li>
<li>Check the return value of every system call, command, and check and bomb out early if anything looks weird</li>
<li>Make sure that proper permissions of files and directories are owned by root (e.g. the config must be owned by root to work)</li>
<li>Don't trust any non-root inputs (like config values) unless they have been checked and/or sanitized</li>
<li>As much IO as possible is done via the calling user (not root)</li>
<li>Put as much system administrator control into the configuration file as possible</li>
<li>Drop permissions before running any non trusted code pathways</li>
<li>Limit all user actions within the container to that single user (disable escalation of privileges within a container)</li>
<li>All root owned files are encapsulated within a user owned image</li>
</ol>
Additionally Singularity is being evaluated for inclusion into some large
Linux distributions which will get more eyes on the code.
</p>
<h2>The Singularity work-flow</h2>
<p>
Because users can not obtain root within the container environment, if they
want to be root inside the container they must first be root outside the
container. This drastically limits the exposure of what users can
potentially do on an physical host. As a result of that, the lines can be
blurred between container and host. It also defines the work-flow of a
container. It must be developed and modified on a host where the owner
has root level access and control or provided to them by a system
administrator. To run or use the container the user does not need root
or any other system privileges as they are the same user inside the
container as they are outside the container. This is what makes Singularity
very effective at running on shared multi-tenant resources.
</p>
<h2>If you think you found a security hole</h2>
<p>
While we are not deluded enough to consider Singularity perfect, it does
have our foremost attention. If you think you have found an escalation
pathway, please email any of the primary authors directly so we can
evaluate and determine the best path forward. 
</p>

<h1>But what about...</h1>
<p>
We've heard a bunch of great ideas and some myths about containers,
security and what is possible... Here are a few.
</p>

<h2>The 'user' name-space makes rootless containers possible</h2>
<p>
There are some initiatives to build "rootless" container systems and while
they are possible, they are limited to being able to only support
virtualization of name-spaces and unfortunately create other complexities
and problems for shared multi-tenant resources. For example, they work by
leveraging the CLONE_NEWUSER name-space and then map virtualized user and
groups to alternate physical user and groups. They also don't make it
possible to properly support a user supplied file system because that still
requires physical root on the system (non-root users can not write or
manipulate root owned files which a file system is full of).
</p>

<h2>SUID is so Linux 2, setcap is the wave of the future</h2>
<p>
This is on our radar already, but there are some negatives that require
consideration for example, SUID binaries are much easier to find and thus
can be easily audited, and Linux capabilities have limited network file
system and distribution support. With that said, we are still considering
this, and open to thoughts and perspectives!
