<h3>In layman terms...</h3>
<p>
In addition to the (already widely used and very free open source) standard
BSD 3 clause license, there is also wording specific to contributors which
ensures that we (LBNL and Singularity developers) have permission to release,
distribute and include a particular contribution, enhancement, or fix as part
of Singularity proper. For example any contributions submitted will have the
standard BSD 3 clause terms (unless specifically and otherwise stated) and
that the contribution is comprised of original new code that the contributor
has authority to contribute.
