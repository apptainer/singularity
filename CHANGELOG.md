# CHANGELOG

This is a manually generated log to track changes to the repository for each release. 
Each section should include general headers such as ### Implemented enhancements 
and **Merged pull requests**. All closed issued and bug fixes should be 
represented by the pull requests that fixed them. This log originated with Singularity 2.4
and changes prior to that are (unfortunately) done retrospectively. Critical items to know are:

 - renamed, deprecated, or removed commands
 - defaults that are changed
 - backward incompatible changes (recipe file format? image file format?)
 - migration guidance (how to convert images?)
 - changed behaviour (recipe sections work differently)

## [v2.6.1]

### Bug fixes

 - [nvliblist.conf](https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/blob/master/etc/nvliblist.conf) now has a section for binaries #1681
 - `--nv` can be made default with all action commands in singularity.conf #1681

   container is initiated in its own PID namespace #1221
 - Add `-i` option to image.create to specify the inode ratio. #1759
 - Bind `/dev/nvidia*` into the container when the `--nv` flag is used in 
    conjuction with the `--contain` flag #1358
 - Add `--no-home` option to not mount user $HOME if it is not the $CWD and
   `mount home = yes` is set. #1761

## [v2.5.2](https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/releases/tag/2.5.2) (2018-07-03)

### [Security related fixes](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2018-12021)
 - Removed the option to use overlay images with `singularity mount`.  This 
   flaw could allow a malicious user accessing the host system to access
   sensitive information when coupled with persistent ext3 overlay.
 - Fixed a race condition that might allow a malicious user to bypass directory 
   image restrictions, like mounting the host root filesystem as a container 
   image

### Bug fixes
 - Fix an error in malloc allocation #1620
 - Honor debug flag when pulling from docker hub #1556
 - Fix a bug with passwd abort #1580
 - Allow user to override singularity.conf "mount home = no" with --home option
   #1496
 - Improve debugging output #1535
 - Fix some bugs in bind mounting #1525
 - Define PR_(S|G)ET_NO_NEW_PRIVS in user space so that these features will 
   work with kernels that implement them (like Cray systems) #1506
 - Create /dev/fd and standard streams symlinks in /dev when using minimal dev
   mount or when specifying -c/-C/--contain option #1420
 - Fixed * expansion during app runscript creation #1486

## [v2.5.1](https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/releases/tag/2.5.1) (2018-05-03)

### Bug fixes
 - Corrected a permissions error when attempting to run Singularity from a 
   directory on NFS with root_squash enabled  
 - Fixed a bug that closed a socket early, preventing correct container 
   execution on hosts using identity services like SSSD
 - Fixed a regression that broke the debootstrap agent

## [v2.5.0](https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/releases/tag/2.5.0) (2018-04-27)

### Security related fixes

Patches are provided to prevent a malicious user with the ability to log in to 
the host system and use the Singularity container runtime from carrying out any 
of the following actions:

 - Create world writable files in root-owned directories on the host system by 
   manipulating symbolic links and bind mounts 
 - Create folders outside of the container by manipulating symbolic links in 
   conjunction with the `--nv` option or by bypassing check_mounted function 
   with relative symlinks
 - Bypass the `enable overlay = no` option in the `singularity.conf` 
   configuration file by setting an environment variable
 - Exploit buffer overflows in `src/util/daemon.c` and/or 
   `src/lib/image/ext3/init.c` (reported by Erik Sjölund (DBB, Stockholm 
   University, Sweden))
 - Forge of the pid_path to join any Singularity namespace (reported by Erik 
   Sjölund (DBB, Stockholm University, Sweden))

### Implemented enhancements

 - Restore docker-extract aufs whiteout handling that implements correct
   extraction of docker container layers. This adds libarchive-devel as a
   build time dep. At runtime libarchive is needed for whiteout handling. If
   libarchive is not available at runtime will fall back to previous
   extraction method.
 - Changed behavior of SINGULARITYENV_PATH to overwrite container PATH and
   added SINGULARITYENV_PREPEND_PATH and SINGULARITYENV_APPEND_PATH for users
   wanting to prepend or append to the container PATH at runtime

### Bug fixes

 - Support pulls from the NVIDIA cloud docker registry (fix by Justin Riley, 
   Harvard)
 - Close socket file descriptors in fd_cleanup
 - Fix conflict between `--nv` and `--contain` options
 - Throw errors at build and runtime if NO_NEW_PRIVS is not present and working
 - Reset umask to 0022 at start to corrrect several errors
 - Verify docker layers after download with sha256 checksum
 - Do not make excessive requests for auth tokens to docker registries
 - Fixed stripping whitespaces and empty new lines for the app commands (fix by 
   Rafal Gumienny, Biozentrum, Basel)
 - Improved the way that working directory is mounted 
 - Fixed an out of bounds array in src/lib/image/ext3/init.c

## [v2.4.6](https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/releases/tag/2.4.6) (2018-04-04)

 - Fix for check_mounted() to check parent directories #1436
 - Free strdupped temporary variable in joinpath #1438

## [v2.4.5](https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/releases/tag/2.4.5) (2018-03-19)

### Security related fixes
 - Strip authorization header on http redirect to different domain when
   interacting with docker registries.

## [v2.4.4](https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/releases/tag/2.4.4) (2018-03-03)

 - Removed capability to handle docker layer aufs whiteout files correctly as
   it increased potential attack surface on some distros (with apologies to 
   users who requested it).

## [v2.4.3](https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/releases/tag/2.4.3) (2018-03-03)
