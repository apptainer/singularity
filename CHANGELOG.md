# v3.6.3 - [2020-09-15]

## Security related fixes

Singularity 3.6.3 addresses the following security issues.

  - [CVE-2020-25039](https://github.com/hpcng/singularity/security/advisories/GHSA-w6v2-qchm-grj7):
    When a Singularity action command (run, shell, exec) is run with
    the fakeroot or user namespace option, Singularity will extract a
    container image to a temporary sandbox directory. Due to insecure
    permissions on the temporary directory it is possible for any user
    with access to the system to read the contents of the
    image. Additionally, if the image contains a world-writable file
    or directory, it is possible for a user to inject arbitrary
    content into the running container.

  - [CVE-2020-25040](https://github.com/hpcng/singularity/security/advisories/GHSA-jv9c-w74q-6762):
    When a Singularity command that results in a container build
    operation is executed, it is possible for a user with access to
    the system to read the contents of the image during the
    build. Additionally, if the image contains a world-writable file
    or directory, it is possible for a user to inject arbitrary
    content into the running build, which in certain circumstances may
    enable arbitrary code execution during the build and/or when the
    built container is run.
    
## Change defaults / behaviours

  - Change the default number of loop devices from 256 to 10000
  - Use LOOP_CTL_GET_FREE to get a new free loop device instead of checking each
    loop device to see if it is free

## Bug Fixes

  - Add CAP_MKNOD in capability bounding set of RPC to fix issue with
    cryptsetup when decrypting image from within a docker container.
  - Fix decryption issue when using both IPC and PID namespaces.
  - Fix unsupported builtins panic from shell interpreter and add umask
    support for definition file scripts.
  - Do not load keyring in prepare_linux if ECL not enabled.
  - Ensure sandbox option overrides remote build destination.
  - Fix a bug that makes the host allocate a large number of loop devices
    and become unresponsive


# v3.6.2 - [2020-08-25]

## New features / functionalities

  - Add --force option to `singularity delete` for non-interactive
    workflows.

## Change defaults / behaviours

  - Default to current architecture for `singularity delete`.

## Bug Fixes

  - Respect current remote for `singularity delete` command.
  - Allow `rw` as a (noop) bind option.
  - Fix capability handling regression in overlay mount.
  - Fix LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment override regression with
    `--nv/--rocm`.
  - Fix environment variable duplication within singularity engine.
  - Use `-user-xattrs` for unsquashfs to avoid error with rootless
    extraction using unsquashfs 3.4 (Ubuntu 20.04).
  - Correct `--no-home` message for 3.6 CWD behavior.
  - Don't fail if parent of cache dir not accessible.
  - Fix tests for Go 1.15 Ctty handling.
  - Fix additional issues with test images on ARM64. 
  - Fix FUSE e2e tests to use container ssh_config.


# v3.6.1 - [2020-07-21]

## New features / functionalities

  - Support compilation with `FORTIFY_SOURCE=2` and build in `pie`
    mode with `fstack-protector` enabled (#5433).

## Bug Fixes

  - Provide advisory message r.e. need for `upper` and `work` to
    exist in overlay images.
  - Use squashfs mem and processor limits in squashfs gzip check.
  - Ensure build destination path is not an empty string - do
    not overwrite CWD.
  - Don't unset PATH when interpreting legacy /environment files.


# v3.6.0 - [2020-07-14]

## Security related fixes

Singularity 3.6.0 introduces a new signature format for SIF images,
and changes to the signing / verification code to address:

  - [CVE-2020-13845](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2020-13845)
    In Singularity 3.x versions below 3.6.0, issues allow the ECL to
    be bypassed by a malicious user.
  - [CVE-2020-13846](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2020-13846)
    In Singularity 3.5 the `--all / -a` option to `singularity verify`
    returns success even when some objects in a SIF container are not
    signed, or cannot be verified.
  - [CVE-2020-13847](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2020-13847)
    In Singularity 3.x versions below 3.6.0, Singularity's sign and
    verify commands do not sign metadata found in the global header or
    data object descriptors of a SIF file, allowing an attacker to
    cause unexpected behavior. A signed container may verify
    successfully, even when it has been modified in ways that could be
    exploited to cause malicious behavior.

Please see the published security advisories at
https://github.com/hpcng/singularity/security/advisories for full
detail of these security issues.

Note that the new signature format is necessarily incompatible with
Singularity < 3.6.0 - e.g. Singularity 3.5.3 cannot verify containers
signed by 3.6.0.

We thank Tru Huynh for a report that led to the review of, and changes to,
the signature implementation.

## New features / functionalities
  - Singularity now supports the execution of minimal Docker/OCI
    containers that do not contain `/bin/sh`, e.g. `docker://hello-world`.
  - A new cache structure is used that is concurrency safe on a filesystem that
    supports atomic rename. *If you downgrade to Singularity 3.5 or older after
    using 3.6 you will need to run `singularity cache clean`.*
  - A plugin system rework adds new hook points that will allow the
    development of plugins that modify behavior of the runtime. An image driver
    concept is introduced for plugins to support new ways of handling image and
    overlay mounts. *Plugins built for <=3.5 are not compatible with 3.6*.
  - The `--bind` flag can now bind directories from a SIF or ext3 image into a
    container.
  - The `--fusemount` feature to mount filesystems to a container via FUSE
    drivers is now a supported feature (previously an experimental hidden flag).
    This permits users to mount e.g. `sshfs` and `cvmfs` filesystems to the
    container at runtime.
  - A new `-c/--config` flag allows an alternative `singularity.conf` to be
    specified by the `root` user, or all users in an unprivileged installation.
  - A new `--env` flag allows container environment variables to be set via the
    Singularity command line.
  - A new `--env-file` flag allows container environment variables to be set from
    a specified file.
  - A new `--days` flag for `cache clean` allows removal of items older than a
    specified number of days. Replaces the `--name` flag which is not generally
    useful as the cache entries are stored by hash, not a friendly name.
  - A new '--legacy-insecure' flag to `verify` allows verification of SIF signatures
    in the old, insecure format.
  - A new '-l / --logs' flag for `instance list` that shows the paths
    to instance STDERR / STDOUT log files.
  - The `--json` output of `instance list` now include paths to STDERR
    / STDOUT log files.

## Changed defaults / behaviours
  - New signature format (see security fixes above).
  - Environment variables prefixed with `SINGULARITYENV_` always take
    precedence over variables without `SINGULARITYENV_` prefix.
  - The `%post` build section inherits environment variables from the base image.
  - `%files from ...` will now follow symlinks for sources that are directly
    specified, or directly resolved from a glob pattern. It will not follow
    symlinks found through directory traversal. This mirrors Docker multi-stage
    COPY behaviour.
  - Restored the CWD mount behaviour of v2, implying that CWD path is not recreated
    inside container and any symlinks in the CWD path are not resolved anymore to
    determine the destination path inside container.
  - The `%test` build section is executed the same manner as `singularity test image`.
  - `--fusemount` with the `container:` default directive will foreground the FUSE
     process. Use `container-daemon:` for previous behavior.
  - Fixed spacing of `singularity instance list` to be dynamically changing based off of
    input lengths instead of fixed number of spaces to account for long instance names. 

## Deprecated / removed commands
  - Removed `--name` flag for `cache clean`; replaced with `--days`.
  - Deprecate `-a / --all` option to `sign/verify` as new signature
    behavior makes this the default.

## Bug Fixes
  - Don't try to mount `$HOME` when it is `/` (e.g. `nobody` user).
  - Process `%appinstall` sections in order when building from a definition file.
  - Ensure `SINGULARITY_CONTAINER`, `SINGULARITY_ENVIRONMENT` and the custom
    shell prompt are set inside a container.
  - Honor insecure registry settings from `/etc/containers/registries.conf`.
  - Fix `http_proxy` env var handling in `yum` bootstrap builds.
  - Disable log colorization when output location is not a terminal.
  - Check encryption keys are usable before beginning an encrypted build.
  - Allow app names with non-alphanumeric characters.
  - Use the `base` metapackage for arch bootstrap builds - arch no longer has a
    `base` group.
  - Ensure library client messages are logged with `--debug`.
  - Do not mount `$HOME` with `--fakeroot --contain`.
  - Fall back to underlay automatically when using a sandbox on GPFS.
  - Fix Ctrl-Z handling - propagation of signal.


# v3.5.3 - [2020.02.18]

## Changed defaults / behaviours

The following minor behaviour changes have been made in 3.5.3 to allow
correct operation on CRAY CLE6, and correct an issue with multi-stage
image builds that was blocking use by build systems such as Spack:

  - Container action scripts are no longer bound in from `etc/actions.d` on the
    host. They are created dynamically and inserted at container startup.
  - `%files from ...` will no longer follow symlinks when copying between
    stages in a multi stage build, as symlinks should be copied so that they
    resolve identically in later stages. Copying `%files` from the host will
    still maintain previous behavior of following links.

## Bug Fixes

  - Bind additional CUDA 10.2 libs when using the `--nv` option without
    `nvidia-container-cli`.
  - Fix an NVIDIA persistenced socket bind error with `--writable`.
  - Add detection of ceph to allow workarounds that avoid issues with
    sandboxes on ceph filesystems.
  - Ensure setgid is inherited during make install.
  - Ensure the root directory of a build has owner write permissions,
    regardless of the permissions in the bootstrap source.
  - Fix a regression in `%post` and `%test` to honor the `-c` option.
  - Fix an issue running `%post` when a container doesn't have
    `/etc/resolv.conf` or `/etc/hosts` files.
  - Fix an issue with UID detection on RHEL6 when running instances.
  - Fix a logic error when a sandbox image is in an overlay incompatible
    location, and both overlay and underlay are disabled globally.
  - Fix an issue causing user namespace to always be used when `allow-setuid=no`
    was configured in a setuid installation.
  - Always allow key IDs and fingerprints to be specified with or without a `0x`
    prefix when using `singularity keys` 
  - Fix an issue preventing joining an instance started with `--boot`.
  - Provide a useful error message if an invalid library:// path is provided.
  - Bring in multi-part upload client functionality that will address large
    image upload / proxied upload issues with a future update to Sylabs cloud.

In addition, numerous improvements have been made to the test suites, allowing
them to pass cleanly on a range of kernel versions and distributions that are
not covered by the open-source CI runs.

  - Provides a useful warning r.e. possible fakeroot build issues when seccomp
    support is not available.
  - Fixes an issue where the `--disable-cache` option was not being honored.

 - Deprecated `--groupid` flag for `sign` and `verify`; replaced with `--group-id`.
 - Removed useless flag `--url` for `sign`.

# v3.5.1 - [2019.12.05]

## New features / functionalities

A single feature has been added in the bugfix release, with specific
functionality:

  - A new option `allow container encrypted` can be set to `no` in
      `singularity.conf` to prevent execution of encrypted containers.

## Bug Fixes

This point release addresses the following issues:

  - Fixes a disk space leak when building from docker-archive.
  - Makes container process SIGABRT return the expected code.
  - Fixes the `inspect` command in unprivileged workflow.
  - Sets an appropriate default umask during build stages, to avoid issues with
      very restrictive user umasks.
  - Fixes an issue with build script content being consumed from STDIN.
  - Corrects the behaviour of underlay with non-empty / symlinked CWD and absolute
    symlink binds targets.
  - Fixes execution of containers when binding BTRFS filesystems.
  - Fixes build / check failures for MIPS & PPC64.
  - Ensures file ownership maintained when building image from sandbox.
  - Fixes a squashfs mount error on kernel 5.4.0 and above.

    lustre filesystems.

# v3.5.0 - [2019.11.13]

## New features / functionalities

  - New support for AMD GPUs via `--rocm` option added to bind ROCm devices and
    libraries into containers.
  - Plugins can now modify Singularity behaviour with two mutators: CLI and
    Runtime.

    mappings for `--fakeroot` from the Singularity CLI.
      
## Changed defaults / behaviours

  - Go 1.13 adopted.
  - Vendored modules removed from the Git tree, will be included in release tarballs.
  - Singularity will now fail with an error if a requested bind mount cannot be
      made.
    - This is beneficial to fail fast in workflows where a task may fail a long
         way downstream if a bind mount is unavailable.
    - Any unavailable bind mount sources must be removed from
        `singularity.conf`.
  - Docker/OCI image extraction now faithfully respects layer
    permissions.
    - This may lead to sandboxes that cannot be removed without
    modifying permissions.

# v3.0.1 - [2018.10.31]

  - Improved RPM packaging procedure via makeit
  - Enhanced general stability of runtime

# v3.0.0 - [2018.10.08]

  - Singularity is now written primarily in Go to bring better integration with the existing container ecosystem
  - Added support for new URIs (`build` & `run/exec/shell/start`):
    - `library://` - Supports the [Sylabs.io Cloud Library](https://cloud.sylabs.io/library)
    - `docker-daemon:` - Supports images managed by the locally running docker daemon
    - `docker-archive:` - Supports archived docker images
    - `oci:` - Supports oci images
    - `oci-archive:` - Supports archived oci images
  - Handling of `docker` & `oci` URIs/images now utilizes [containers/image](https://github.com/containers/image) to parse and convert those image types in a supported way
  - Replaced `singularity instance.*` command group with `singularity instance *`
  - The command `singularity help` now only provides help regarding the usage of the `singularity` command. To display an image's `help` message, use `singularity run-help <image path>` instead
 
## Removed Deprecated Commands
  - Removed deprecated `singularity image.*` command group
  - Removed deprecated `singularity create` command
  - Removed deprecated `singularity bootstrap` command
  - Removed deprecated `singularity mount` command
  - Removed deprecated `singularity check` command

## New Commands
  - Added `singularity run-help <image path>` command to output an image's `help` message
  - Added `singularity sign <image path>` command to allow a user to cryptographically sign a SIF image
  - Added `singularity verify <image path>` command to allow a user to verify a SIF image's cryptographic signatures
  - Added `singularity keys` command to allow the management of `OpenPGP` key stores
  - Added `singularity capability` command to allow fine grained control over the capabilities of running containers
  - Added `singularity push` command to push images to the [Sylabs.io Cloud Library](https://cloud.sylabs.io/library)

## Changed Commands

### Action Command Group (`run/shell/exec/instance start`)
  - Added flags:
    - `--add-caps <string>`: Run the contained process with the specified capability set (requires root)
    - `--allow-setuid`: Allows setuid binaries to be mounted into the container (requires root)
    - `--apply-cgroups <path>`: Apply cgroups configuration from file to contained processes (requires root)
    - `--dns <string>`: Adds the comma separated list of DNS servers to the containers `resolv.conf` file
    - `--drop-caps <string>`: Drop the specified capabilities from the container (requires root)
    - `--fakeroot`: Run the container in a user namespace as `uid=0`. Requires a recent kernel to function properly
    - `--hostname <string>`: Set the hostname of the container
    - `--keep-privs`: Keep root user privilege inside the container (requires root)
    - `--network <string>`: Specify a list of comma separated network types ([CNI Plugins](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni)) to be present inside the container, each with its own dedicated interface in the container
    - `--network-args <string>`: Specify arguments to pass to CNI network plugins (set by `--network`)
    - `--no-privs`: Drop all privileges from root user inside the container (requires root)
    - `--security <string>`: Configure security features such as SELinux, Apparmor, Seccomp...
    - `--writable-tmpfs`: Run container with a `tmpfs` overlay
  - The command `singularity instance start` now supports the `--boot` flag to boot the container via `/sbin/init`
  - Changes to image mounting behavior:
    - All image formats are mounted as read only by default
    - `--writable` only works on images which can be mounted in read/write [applicable to: `sandbox` and legacy `ext3` images]
    - `--writable-tmpfs` runs the container with a writable `tmpfs`-based overlay [applicable to: all image formats]
    - `--overlay <string>` now specifies a list of `ext3`/`sandbox` images which are set as the containers overlay [applicable to: all image formats] 

### Build Command:
  - All images are now built as [Singularity Image Format (SIF)](https://www.sylabs.io/2018/03/sif-containing-your-containers/) images by default
  - When building to a path that already exists, `singularity build` will now prompt the user if they wish to overwrite the file existing at the specified location
  - The `-w|--writable` flag has been removed
  - The `-F|--force` flag now overrides the interactive prompt and will always attempt to overwrite the file existing at the specified location
  - The `-u|--update` flag has been added to support the workflow of running a definition file on top of an existing container [implies `--sandbox`, only supports `sandbox` image types]
  - The `singularity build` command now supports the following flags for integration with the [Sylabs.io Cloud Library](https://cloud.sylabs.io/library):
    - `-r|--remote`: Build the image remotely on the Sylabs Remote Builder (currently unavailable)
    - `-d|--detached`: Detach from the `stdout` of the remote build [requires `--remote`]
    - `--builder <string>`: Specifies the URL of the remote builder to access
    - `--library <string>`: Specifies the URL of the [Sylabs.io Cloud Library](https://cloud.sylabs.io/library) to push the built image to when the build command destination is in the form `library://<reference>`
  - The `bootstrap` keyword in the definition file now supports the following values:
    - `library`
    - `docker-daemon`
    - `docker-archive`
    - `oci`
    - `oci-archive`
  - The `from` keyword in the definition file now correctly parses a `docker` URI which includes the `registry` and/or `namespace` components
  - The `registry` and `namespace` keywords in the definition file are no longer supported. Instead, those values may all go into the `from` keyword
  - Building from a tar archive of a `sandbox` no longer works
