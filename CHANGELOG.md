# CHANGELOG

This is a manually generated log to track changes to the repository for each release. 
Each section should include general headers such as ### Implemented enhancements 
and **Merged pull requests**. All closed issued and bug fixes should be 
represented by the pull requests that fixed them. This log originated with Singularity 2.4
and changes prior to that are (unfortunately) done retrospectively. Critical items to know are:

 - renamed, deprecated, or removed commands
 - defaults that are changed
 - backward incompatible changes (recipe file format? image file format?)
 - migration guidance (how to convert images?)
 - changed behaviour (recipe sections work differently)

## [v2.5](https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/tree/release-2.5)

 - Restore docker-extract aufs whiteout handling that implements correct
     extraction of docker container layers. This adds libarchive-devel as a
     build time dep. At runtime libarchive is needed for whiteout handling. If
     libarchive is not available at runtime will fall back to previous
     extraction method. 
 - Put /usr/local/{bin,sbin} in front of the default PATH
 - Adjustments to SCIF (Scientific Filesystem) integration for broader use
 - Fixed bug that did not export environment variables for apps with "-" in name
 - Fix conflict between `--nv` and `--contain` options
 - Removed overeager check for known invalid recipe file extension


## [v2.4.4](https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/tree/release-2.4)

 - Removed capability to handle docker layer aufs whiteout files correctly as
   it increased potential attack surface on some distros (with apologies to 
   users who requested it).

## [v2.4.3](https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/tree/release-2.4)

 - Fix permission denied when binding directory located on NFS with root_squash enabled
 - Add capability to support all tar compression formats #1155
 - Handle docker layer aufs whiteout files correctly (requires libarchive).
 - Close file descriptors pointing to a directory #1305
 - Updated output of image.print command #1190
 - Fixed parsing of backslashes in apprun script #1189
 - Fixed parsing of arch keyword from definition file #1217
 - Fixed incompatibility between --pwd and --contain options #1259
 - Updated license information #1267
 - Fix non-root build from docker containers with non-writable file/dir permissions
 - Fix race condition between container exit and cleanupd while removing runtime directory

## [v2.4.2](https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/tree/release-2.4)

 - This fixed an issue for support of older distributions and kernels with regards to `setns()`
   functionality.
 - Fixed autofs bug path (lost during merge)
