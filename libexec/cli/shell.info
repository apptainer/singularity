Obtain an interactive shell (/bin/bash) within the container image.


SHELL OPTIONS:
    -a|--app            Include an installed container app in the environment
    -B|--bind <spec>    A user-bind path specification.  spec has the format
                        src[:dest[:opts]], where src and dest are outside and
                        inside paths.  If dest is not given, it is set equal
                        to src.  Mount options ('opts') may be specified as
                        'ro' (read-only) or 'rw' (read/write, which is the
                        default). This option can be called multiple times.
    -c|--contain        Use minimal /dev and empty other directories (e.g. /tmp
                        and $HOME) instead of sharing filesystems on your host
    -C|--containall     Contain not only file systems, but also PID and IPC
    -e|--cleanenv       Clean environment before running container
    -H|--home <spec>    A home directory specification.  spec can either be a
                        src path or src:dest pair.  src is the source path
                        of the home directory outside the container and dest
                        overrides the home directory within the container
    -i|--ipc            Run container in a new IPC namespace
    -j|--join           Join a running named instance of the given container 
                        image
    -n|--net            Run container in a new network namespace (loopback is
                        only network device active)
    --nv                Enable experimental Nvidia support
    -o|--overlay        Use a persistent overlayFS via a writable image
    -p|--pid            Run container in a new PID namespace (creates child)
    --uts               Run container in a new UTS namespace
    --pwd               Initial working directory for payload process inside
                        the container
    -S|--scratch <path> Include a scratch directory within the container that
                        is linked to a temporary dir (use -W to force location)
    -s|--shell <shell>  Path to program to use for interactive shell
    -u|--userns         Run container in a new user namespace (this allows
                        Singularity to run completely unprivileged on recent
                        kernels and doesn't support all features)
    -W|--workdir        Working directory to be used for /tmp, /var/tmp and
                        $HOME (if -c/--contain was also used)
    -w|--writable       By default all Singularity containers are available as
                        read only. This option makes the file system accessible
                        as read/write.
    --hostname          Set container hostname
    -f|--fakeroot       Run container in a new user namespace as root uid/gid
    --keep-privs        Lets root user to keep all privileges (root only)
    --no-privs          Drop all privileges, for root user only as privilieges
                        are always dropped for users
    --add-caps          A comma separated capability list to add
                        Accepted formats:
                            - CAP_CHOWN,CAP_SETUID
                            - CHOWN,SETUID
                            - cap_chown,cap_setuid
                            - chown,setuid
    --drop-caps         A comma separated capability list to drop
    --allow-setuid      Allow setuid binaries in container (root only)


CONTAINER FORMATS SUPPORTED:
    *.sqsh              SquashFS format.  Native to Singularity 2.4+
    *.img               This is the native Singularity image format for all
                        Singularity versions < 2.4.
    *.tar*              Tar archives are exploded to a temporary directory and
                        run within that directory (and cleaned up after). The
                        contents of the archive is a root file system with root
                        being in the current directory. All compression
                        suffixes are supported.
    directory/          Container directories that contain a valid root file
                        system.
    instance://*        A local running instance of a container. (See the
                        instance command group.)
    shub://*            A container hosted on Singularity Hub
    docker://*          A container hosted on Docker Hub
