USAGE: singularity [...] run [run options...] <container path> [...]

This command will launch a Singularity container and execute a runscript
if one is defined for that container. The runscript is a file at
'/singularity'. If this file is present (and executable) then this
command will execute that file within the container automatically. All
arguments following the container name will be passed directly to the
runscript.


RUN OPTIONS:
    -B/--bind <spec>    A user-bind path specification.  spec has the format
                        src[:dest[:opts]], where src and dest are outside and
                        inside paths.  If dest is not given, it is set equal
                        to src.  Mount options ('opts') may be specified as
                        'ro' (read-only) or 'rw' (read/write, which is the 
                        default). This option can be called multiple times.
    -c/--contain        This option disables the automatic sharing of writable
                        filesystems on your host (e.g. $HOME and /tmp).
    -C/--containall     Contain not only file systems, but also PID and IPC
    -e/--cleanenv       Clean environment before running container
    -H/--home <spec>    A home directory specification.  spec can either be a
                        src path or src:dest pair.  src is the source path
                        of the home directory outside the container and dest
                        overrides the home directory within the container
    -i/--ipc            Run container in a new IPC namespace
    -p/--pid            Run container in a new PID namespace
    --pwd               Initial working directory for payload process inside
                        the container
    -S/--scratch <path> Include a scratch directory within the container that 
                        is linked to a temporary dir (use -W to force location)
    -u/--user           Try to run completely unprivileged (only works on very
                        new kernels/distros)
    -W/--workdir        Working directory to be used for /tmp, /var/tmp and
                        $HOME (if -c/--contain was also used)
    -w/--writable       By default all Singularity containers are available as
                        read only. This option makes the file system accessible
                        as read/write.

CONTAINER FORMATS SUPPORTED:
    *.img               This is the native Singularity image format for all
                        Singularity versions 2.x.
    *.sqsh              SquashFS format, note the suffix is required!
    *.tar*              Tar archives are exploded to a temporary directory and
                        run within that directory (and cleaned up after). 
                        Compression suffixes as '.gz' and 'bz2' are supported.
    directory/          Container directories that contain a valid root file
                        system.


EXAMPLES:

    $ singularity exec /tmp/Debian.img cat /singularity
    #!/bin/sh
    echo "Hello world: $@"
    $ singularity run /tmp/Debian.img one two three
    Hello world: one two three
