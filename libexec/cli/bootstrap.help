USAGE: singularity [...] bootstrap <container path> <definition file>

******************************************************************************
WARNING: The bootstrap command is deprecated and will be removed in a later 
version of Singularity.  bootstrap now uses build to create a writable
container from an existing image via the following syntax:

$ singularity build -e -w container.img recipe.def

You should update your usage accordingly. 
******************************************************************************

The bootstrap command is useful for creating a new bootstrap or modifying an
existing one using a definition file that describes how to build the
container. The quickest, easiest Bootstrap is dumping Docker layers into
a container:

    BootStrap: docker
    From: library/ubuntu:14.04.1

Optionally, you can perform container checks with --checks.
For more documentation on definition file recipes, look below.

note: This command must be executed as root.



CREATE OPTIONS:
    -T|--notest     Bootstrap without running tests in %test section
    -s|--section    Only run a given section within the bootstrap (setup,
                    post, files, environment, test, labels, none)


CHECKS OPTIONS:
    -c|--checks    enable checks
    -t|--tag       specify a check tag (not default)
    -l/--low       Specify low threshold (all checks, default) 
    -m/--med       Perform medium and high checks
    -h/--high      Perform only checks at level high

DEFFILE BASEOS EXAMPLES:

    Docker:
        Bootstrap: docker
        From: tensorflow/tensorflow:latest
        IncludeCmd: yes # Use the CMD as runscript instead of ENTRYPOINT

    YUM/RHEL:
        Bootstrap: yum
        OSVersion: 7
        MirrorURL: http://mirror.centos.org/centos-%{OSVERSION}/%{OSVERSION}/os/$basearch/
        Include: yum #This is important to include inside the base container

    Debian/Ubuntu:
        Bootstrap: debootstrap
        OSVersion: trusty
        MirrorURL: http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/

    Self:
        Bootstrap: self

    Local Image:
        Bootstrap: localimage
        From: /home/dave/starter.img 


DEFFILE SECTION EXAMPLES:

    %setup
        echo "This is a scriptlet that will be executed on the host, as root, after"
        echo "the container has been bootstrapped. To install things into the container"
        echo "reference the file system location with \$SINGULARITY_BUILDROOT"

    %post
        echo "This scriptlet section will be executed from within the container after"
        echo "the bootstrap/base has been created and setup"

    %test
        echo "Define any test commands that should be executed after container has been"
        echo "built. This scriptlet will be executed from within the running container"
        echo "as the root user. Pay attention to the exit/return value of this scriptlet"
        echo "as any non-zero exit code will be assumed as failure"
        exit 0

    %labels
        HELLO MOTO
        KEY VALUE

    %files
        /path/on/host/file.txt /path/on/container/file.txt 
        relative_file.txt /path/on/container/relative_file.txt
