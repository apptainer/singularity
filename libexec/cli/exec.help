USAGE: singularity [...] exec [exec options...] <container path> <command>

This command will allow you to execute any program within the given
container image.

EXEC OPTIONS:
    -B/--bind <spec>    A user-bind path specification.  spec can either be a
                        path or a src:dest pair, specifying the bind mount to
                        perform (can be called multiple times)
    -c/--contain        This option disables the automatic sharing of writable
                        filesystems on your host (e.g. $HOME and /tmp).
    -C/--containall     Contain not only file systems, but also PID and IPC 
    -H/--home <path>    Path to a different home directory to virtualize within
                        the container
    -i/--ipc            Run container in a new IPC namespace
    -p/--pid            Run container in a new PID namespace
    --pwd               Initial working directory for payload process inside 
                        the container
    -S/--scratch <path> Include a scratch directory within the container that 
                        is linked to a temporary dir (use -W to force location)
    -u/--user           Try to run completely unprivileged (only works on very
                        new kernels/distros)
    -W/--workdir        Working directory to be used for /tmp, /var/tmp and
                        $HOME (if -c/--contain was also used)
    -w/--writable       By default all Singularity containers are available as
                        read only. This option makes the file system accessible
                        as read/write.


NOTE:
    If there is a daemon process running inside the container, then 
    subsequent container commands will all run within the same namespaces.
    This means that the --writable and --contain options will not be
    honored as the namespaces have already been configured by the
    'singularity start' command.


EXAMPLES:
    
    $ singularity exec /tmp/Debian.img cat /etc/debian_version
    $ singularity exec /tmp/Debian.img python ./hello_world.py
    $ cat hello_world.py | singularity exec /tmp/Debian.img python
    $ sudo singularity exec --writable /tmp/Debian.img apt-get update
