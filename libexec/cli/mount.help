USAGE: singularity [...] mount [mount options...] <container path>

Start a shell with a standard loop mount on the container image.  The
mount is in the container namespace, i.e. not visible outside that
shell.

MOUNT OPTIONS:
    -w/--writable       By default all Singularity containers are available as
                        read only. This option makes the file system accessible
                        as read/write.
    -o|--overlay        Use a persistent overlayFS via a writable image

EXAMPLES:

    $ singularity create /tmp/new.img
    $ singularity mount /tmp/new.img
