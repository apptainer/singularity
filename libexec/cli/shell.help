USAGE: singularity [...] shell [shell options...] <container path>

Obtain a shell (/bin/sh) within the container image.

note: When invoking a shell within a container, the container image is
by default writable.


SHELL OPTIONS:
    -B/--bind <spec>    A user-bind path specification.  spec has the format
                        src[:dest[:opts]], where src and dest are outside and
                        inside paths.  If dest is not given, it is set equal
                        to src.  Mount options ('opts') may be specified as
                        'ro' (read-only) or 'rw' (read/write, which is the
                        default). This option can be called multiple times.
    -c/--contain        This option disables the automatic sharing of writable
                        filesystems on your host (e.g. $HOME and /tmp).
    -C/--containall     Contain not only file systems, but also PID and IPC
    -e/--cleanenv       Clean environment before running container
    -H/--home <spec>    A home directory specification.  spec can either be a
                        src path or src:dest pair.  src is the source path
                        of the home directory outside the container and dest
                        overrides the home directory within the container
    -i/--ipc            Run container in a new IPC namespace
    -p/--pid            Run container in a new PID namespace (creates child)
    --pwd               Initial working directory for payload process inside
                        the container
    -S/--scratch <path> Include a scratch directory within the container that
                        is linked to a temporary dir (use -W to force location)
    -s/--shell <shell>  Path to program to use for interactive shell
    -u/--user           Try to run completely unprivileged (only works on very
                        new kernels/distros)
    -W/--workdir        Working directory to be used for /tmp, /var/tmp and
                        $HOME (if -c/--contain was also used)
    -w/--writable       By default all Singularity containers are available as
                        read only. This option makes the file system accessible
                        as read/write.


NOTE:
    If there is a daemon process running inside the container, then 
    subsequent container commands will all run within the same namespaces.
    This means that the --writable and --contain options will not be
    honored as the namespaces have already been configured by the
    'singularity start' command.


EXAMPLES:

    $ singularity shell /tmp/Debian.img
    Singularity/Debian.img> pwd
    /home/gmk/test
    Singularity/Debian.img> exit
    $ singularity shell -C /tmp/Debian.img
    Singularity/Debian.img> pwd
    /home/gmk
    Singularity/Debian.img> ls -l
    total 0
    Singularity/Debian.img> exit
    $ sudo singularity shell -w /tmp/Debian.img
