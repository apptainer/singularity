USAGE: singularity [...] import [import options...] <container path>

By default import opens standard input (stdin) and will accept tar
streams to import into a container. Note that the stream MUST be in
uncompressed tar format or the command will fail.

The tar archive can be anything from a root file system, to a layer you
wish to add to a container, to an existing docker image.

The size of the container you need to create to import a complete system
may be significantly larger than the size of the tar file/stream due to
overheads of the container filesystem.

It is also possible to import from a Docker image specified with -f by
using the format option; that actually creates the container.  Docker
conversion hides substantial complexity and is relatively slow.  It
creates /singularity in the container if the Docker image defines a
Cmd and/or Entrypoint.

note: This command must be executed as root.

IMPORT OPTIONS:
    -f/--file       Use an input file instead of a pipe for tar, or
                    name an image of the specified format to import
    -t/--type       Source type ('tar' or 'docker', default: tar)
       --command    Replace the tar command (DEFAULT: 'tar xvf -')

EXAMPLES:

    Once you have created the base image template:

    $ sudo singularity create /tmp/Debian.img

    You can then import from a tar pipe

    $ gunzip -c debian.tar.gz | sudo singularity import /tmp/Debian
    $ cat debian.tar | sudo singularity import /tmp/Debian.img
    $ sudo singularity import /tmp/Debian.img < debian.tar
    $ sudo singularity import -f Debian.tar /tmp/Debian.img
    $ docker export [container] | sudo singularity import [container].img

    Converting a Docker Fedora image:

    $ sudo singularity import -t docker fedora /tmp/fedora.img
