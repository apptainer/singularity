SUMMARY="Launch a testscript within container"
USAGE="singularity [...] test [exec options...] <container path>"

Run defined tests for this particular container. Tests will be run
contained (e.g. no persistent writable directories will be available 
inside of container) and will be executed as the calling user.    

NOTE:
    If there is a daemon process running inside the container, then 
    subsequent container commands will all run within the same namespaces.
    This means that the --writable and --contain options will not be
    honored as the namespaces have already been configured by the
    'singularity start' command.


EXAMPLES:
    
    $ singularity test /tmp/Debian.img
