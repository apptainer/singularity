SUMMARY="Sign a group of data objects in container"
USAGE="singularity [...] sign <data object id/groupid> <container path>"

print_help() {
cat<<EOF
Compute a sha384 hash of a container image and cryptographically sign the
manifest.

The first argument is the id of the data object to which we want to generate
a signature for. Note that the info about a list of available ids may be found
via the `singularity siflist' command.

The second argument is the container for which data needs to be verified.


EXAMPLES:

    $ singularity sign /tmp/Debian.sif
