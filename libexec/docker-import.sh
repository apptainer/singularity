# The basic technique is:
#   * Create a docker container from the image
#   * Figure out the singularity container size from that
#   * Create the singularity container
#   * docker export | singularity import
#   * Clean up
# It's partly obscured by error checking and recovery in verbose
# if blocks in Singularity style, and determining the size and possible
# /singularity contents is complex.

# Fixme: Check docker "Os" is "linux" [can it be anything else?]
#          Are there any guarantees of contents, like coreutils?
#        Maybe accept docker container instead of image?
#        Options to set extra, tarfactor in import.exec (messy because
#          they're probably specific to the source)
#        Convention for singularity container metadata that could be
#          extracted from docker in this case
#        Can it be sped up somehow?  This takes ~1 min with the minimal
#          fedora image and ~75s with one of ~1GB.
#        Treatment of entrypoint/cmd likely still doesn't match docker
#          properly, in particular "shell" v. "exec"
#        Consider the locale, e.g. for use of =~
