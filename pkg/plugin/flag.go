// arguments:
//
// *pflag.Flag:
//   A pointer to a pflag.Flag object. This object is guaranteed to have been
//   added to the action FlagSet, and will contain the value the flag was
//   set to if it was set.
//
// *singularity.EngineConfig:
//   A pointer to the EngineConfig object which allows the plugin to make
//   modifications to the runtime parameters of the container
//
// This function is guaranteed to be called after the flag has been parsed by
// pflag, and before the starter binary is executed.
