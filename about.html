<h1>About Singularity</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
Software development on Linux is moving in a new direction. Thanks to
advances in virtualization and container technologies, developers are
finding it very convenient to distribute instances of their entire
build/development environment in addition to or instead of source code
alone. There are some benefits and drawbacks to this model.
</p>
<p>
Some of the benefits of distributing software in this fashion include
being able to provide a configuration free implementation which can
easily be replicated to distribute a software or work flow. The user
does not need to worry about managing potentially complicated
dependency chains nor worry about configuration nuances.
</p>
<p>
But the drawback are numerous but tend to focus on several major areas:
container overhead, container technology and architecture concerns (e.g.
privilege escalation and network/file system access), and work flow
compatibility.
</p>

<h2>The Singularity Solution</h2>
<p>
By combining the model of application packaging with containers the
benefits are numerous! We can now address the above mentioned drawbacks
that we have seen in containers using a very intuitive and
architecturally non-invasive user-space solution.
</p>
<p>
Singularity containers are purposed built and can include a simple
binary and library stack or a complicated work flow which includes both
network and file system access (or anything in-between). The
Singularity Application containers (SAPPs) are then completely portable
with their only dependency being Singularity running on the target
system.
</p>
<p>
Because Singularity runs 100% from user space and all container
contents are always executed as the run-time user (non-root) security
concerns are greatly mitigated. On a multi-user resource there is no
longer a need to VLAN a network which is isolated from other users and
file systems. Additionally access to file systems is achieved internally
without the use of bind mounts and relative paths have direct access in
and out of the container thus supporting standard command line usage and
integration with existing work flows (e.g. batch schedulers).
</p>

<h3>Portability</h3>
<p>
A Singularity Application (SAPP) is a package bundle which contains
within it all of the required dependencies necessary to run. It is
like having a statically compiled binary which can be distributed
easily from system to system without concern of even the C library
compatibility.
</p>
<p>
The SAPP package can contain anything from a simple binary
executable to an entire pipeline or work flow of multiple
applications. There could be multiple services which can be run
within the SAPP environment and interaction with the SAPP file is
fully configurable. For example in the simple configuration you may
choose to emulate the program arguments so it operates just like
running the application directly. 
</p>

<h3>Reproducibility</h3>
<p>
Each SAPP includes all of the application's necessary run-time
libraries and can even include the required data and files for a
particular application to run. This encapsulation of the entire
user-space environment facilitates not only portability but also
reproducibility.
</p>

<h3>License</h3>
<p>
Singularity is released under a modified BSD license. The only modification
being that you may not use the name's of any project members or contributors
(namely UC or the US Department of Energy) to endorse or promote products or
